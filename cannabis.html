            <p>Cannabis (or hemp) plants have many culinary uses beyond the buds. Most parts of the plants that aren't the buds won't get you high[2] and you probably have some friends who grow and have other parts of the plants they are willing to give away.</p>
<h2>Plant Types</h2>
<p>There are three different types of plants: sativa, indica, and ruderalis. For what we are using them, it should not matter the differences, but it is good to get used to how their shapes differ[3], mainly so that you are using the part of the plant that you're expecting.</p>
<h2>Fan Leaves</h2>
<p>Note that this is talking about the larger leaves from the plant, probably the ones you are thinking of. The cannabis plant also has smaller leaves protruding from the buds (&quot;sugar leaves&quot;) which contain a much higher amount of cannabinoids, which could result in an unwanted high.</p>
<h3>Raw</h3>
<p>Use them like you would any other green like kale or spinach: smoothies, salads, vegetable roasts, etc.</p>
<h3>Dried</h3>
<h4>Tea</h4>
<p>First you will need to take the leaves and spread them out to dry fully. I let them sit in direct sunlight until they were fully dried, but I assume you could also do this in a dehydrator or an extremely low heat oven.</p>
<p>Once dried, remove the stems and break up the leaves until they are small enough to measure with a teaspoon.</p>
<p>To make a cup of tea, measure out one to two teaspoons per 8oz cup, let steep for a minute or so. You know, make tea.</p>
