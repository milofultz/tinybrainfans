<main id="main"><article id="content">            <h1 id="title">Salary Negotiation</h1>
            <p>Like <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/negotiating-comp" target="_blank">the article I am summarizing from</a>, <strong>I hate this</strong>. I'm hoping that through using this information, I can better advocate for myself and be a greater force for the values and principles I believe in.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't give hard numbers to recruiters; ask for a range that you can discuss later</li>
<li>
Ask questions of the employer during the interview to use in negotiations<ul>
<li>What’s the biggest priority for the team right now?</li>
<li>Why is this role open?</li>
<li>What’s the biggest challenge for someone stepping into this role?</li>
<li>How does the org structure on the team work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When offered a job, <em>still</em> don't give hard numbers; recruiters are still working for the company after all</li>
<li>
At FAANG companies, salary is often decided by a team; giving a number can only hurt later negotiations (if you do end up giving a number, renogiations will be necessary when counteroffers are given from other companies or your current one). Evaluate what your initial offer from the company means using the band you asked for at step 1:<ul>
<li>Below: Ask for feedback on why they perceive you to be at the bottom of the band and fix any misconceptions before negotiating. You need a solid place to argue from</li>
<li>Middle: You may not have a strong advocate in the company. Match with a team or manager who is willing to do so before negotiating.</li>
<li>Above: There may have been a discussion of putting you at a higher level. Can possibly push out of the aforementioned band.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At startups, it's more of a wild west scenario; figure out the current state of the company in terms of finances, wher you will be at the company and what you'll be doing, and the value of the equity they will offer you. You are going to be an investor in the startup, so treat it like you would any investment: be skeptical, ask a LOT of questions, vet thoroughly, do tons of research.</li>
<li>Win the support of your future teammates and current decision-makers; understanding what they want and need from who fills the role and how you can help them achieve it will make it more likely for them to vouch for you and the higher wage.</li>
<li>
Compare the data you have gotten with existing data: does it make sense? Compare<ul>
<li>Wages</li>
<li>Value of the equity</li>
<li>Stocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Compare this offer with all others you have received. Determine which has the qualities you most desire in a company:<ul>
<li>Long term trajectory</li>
<li>Company culture</li>
<li>Promotion structure</li>
<li>Manager's ability to vouch for you</li>
<li>Brand worth for <em>your</em> long term trajectory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make the ask. WIth the data you have considered and what <strong>you</strong> need, make the ask that is best for you, justified by the data.</li>
</ol>
