            <h2>Commits</h2>
<p>Add files you want to commit: <code>git add {file or folder name}</code>. You can also add all by using <code>git add .</code>, but this is not recommended, as you don't want to add all unless you are POSITIVE it doesn't contain cruft or unwanted changes, which is rarely the case. An easy way to check what has changed in your files since last commit is to use the <code>--patch</code> flag.</p>
<h3><code>--patch</code></h3>
<p>Add only portions of a file as 'hunks': <code>git add --patch/-p {file or folder name}</code> (file or folder is optional). This will prompt you with options:</p>
<ul>
<li>y - stage this hunk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>n - do not stage this hunk</li>
<li>q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones</li>
<li>a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file</li>
<li>d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file</li>
<li>g - select a hunk to go to</li>
<li>/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex</li>
<li>j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk</li>
<li>J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk</li>
<li>k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk</li>
<li>K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk</li>
<li>s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks</li>
<li>e - <a href="https://rietta.com/blog/git-patch-manual-split/" target="_blank">manually edit the current hunk</a> (particularly if your code is really close together but needs to be broken down)</li>
<li>? - print help</li>
</ul>
<h3>Case Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Git by default is not case sensitive when it comes to filenames and will ignore renaming of file structures that are only by case. To change this default behavior, use <code>git config core.ignorecase false</code>. <strong>Note that setting this option to false on a case-insensitive file system is generally a bad idea. Doing so will lead to weird errors. For example, renaming a file in a way that only changes letter case will cause git to report spurious conflicts or create duplicate files.</strong></p>
<p>If it is a file or files, you can change their name as normal and then within git via this command: <code>git mv -f filename.txt Filename.txt</code>. This will make it show up in your commit. If it is a directory, you will need to do this with every file within the directory.</p>

</tbody></table><h3>Orphan Branches</h3>
<p>Commits usually have one parent, their previous iteration. The root commit (very beginning) of your repo has none, and when you merge commit a fork with another branch or the master branch.</p>
<p>An orphan branch is a new root commit, where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first commit made on this new branch will have no parents, and it will be the root of a new history, totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits. In other words, it creates a new root commit and uses it as a starting point for your new branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Delete All Merged Branches</h3>
<p>To delete all branches that have been merged, start out by pulling from remote to ensure you are using the most up to date info. Then check which branches are merged by running <code>git branch --merged</code>. We will be using <code>egrep</code> to grab these and put them into a macro that will delete each merged branch that doesn't fit within the regex. To ensure a branch that contains a certain keyword does not get deleted, add it to the <code>egrep -v &quot;(^...)&quot;</code> line, with each keyword separated by an OR <code>|</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git branch --merged | egrep -v &quot;(^\*|master|main|dev|staging)&quot; | xargs git branch -d
</code></pre>
<h2>Cherry Pick</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When should I use cherry-pick? <strong>The short answer is: as rarely as possible.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this reason, I have not spent much time learning how to get this to work, as the only experience I have had was one of my colleagues using this and causing hours of work trying to fix the side effects.</p>
<h2>Revert</h2>
<p>A revert allows you to go back to a previous commit, reversing those previous between commit X (HEAD) and commit Y (the selected commit). This will create a reversal commit for each commit to be undone between X and Y. In the case of a single commit to be undone, it will make a single reversal commit.</p>
<p>To revert one or many commits, open your <code>git log</code> and find the commit you want to revert back to. Save this hash. Then enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git revert [-m 1] &lt;commit-hash&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag is used to revert a merge; to set where the mainline is, which parent you are wanting to revert back to. Most of the time it is 1. </p>
<p>For example, lets say you accidentally committed to the main branch and pushed up. You can revert this with <code>git revert HEAD</code> or <code>git revert {hash}</code>, creating a commit dialog and fixing your mistake through <em>adding</em> to your commit history.</p>
<h2>Stashing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-stash-explained/" target="_blank">Stashing</a> allows you to temporarily save changes without committing anything. </p>
<p>To stash some changes, use <code>git stash save &#x27;message about stash&#x27;</code>, or just <code>git stash</code> if you want to leave out the message.</p>
<p>To see what you have stashed, use <code>git stash list</code> to see all stashed code. Then see what is in each stash by using <code>git stash show {index}</code>, and you can see it diffed by using the <code>-p</code> flag.</p>
<p>Stashes can be listed recalled via the indexes shown: <code>git stash apply {index}</code> or <code>git stash pop {index}</code> if you want to remove it from the stashes after being applied.</p>
<p>You can <code>git stash drop {index}</code> individual stashes or <code>git stash clear</code> the entire stash.</p>
<h2>Resolving Merge Conflicts in Pull Requests</h2>
<p>To resolve a merge conflict in a pull request, you can use <code>git merge {target-branch}</code>, where <code>{target-branch}</code> is the branch you are hoping to eventually merge your code into. This will create your merge conflicts locally, where you can create a new commit to handle them and <a href="rebase-git.html">rebase</a> if you want to clean it up.</p>
<h2>Credentials</h2>
<p>If you receive a message like this when trying to push up to your repo:</p>
<pre><code>remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied
fatal: Authentication failed for &#x27;https://gitlab.com/myusername/repo.git&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for &#x27;https://github.com/milofultz/tod.git/&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>Then you may have revoked or renewed your token and need to reset it. To do so, type this in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git credential reject
</code></pre>
<p>And when you receive a new line, enter in <code>url=</code> followed by the url that showed up previously in the error message. Then use ctrl-c or ctrl-d to quit.</p>
<pre><code>url=https://github.com/milofultz/tod.git/
</code></pre>
<p>On trying to push again, you will get prompted for authentication and it will work.</p>
<h3>Token</h3>
<p>Github deprecated standard HTTPS for SSH, so if you continue to get this error, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token" target="_blank">generate a new token</a> and use that token in place of your password.</p>
<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>Handle Windows newlines (CRLF =&gt; LF): <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20168639/git-commit-get-fatal-error-fatal-crlf-would-be-replaced-by-lf-in/31144141#31144141" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20168639/git-commit-get-fatal-error-fatal-crlf-would-be-replaced-by-lf-in/31144141#31144141</a></p>
<h2>Meta</h2>
<h3>Simplify git Call</h3>
<p>In your <a href="bash.html">Bash</a> or equivalent rc file, set an alias of <code>g</code> to <code>git</code>. Surprisingly has saved me quite a bit of mistypes and extra key typing.</p>
<h3>Use <a href="vim.html">vim</a> as Editor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install vim using homebrew</li>
<li>Set vim to be the default editor with <code>git config --global core.editor &quot;vim&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
