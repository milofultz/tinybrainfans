<main id="main"><article id="content"><h1 id="title">Rails</h1><p>Rails is a web application framework written in <a href="ruby.html">Ruby</a>. In comparison to something like <a href="node.html">Node</a>'s <a href="express.html">Express</a>, it is a <em>much</em> higher level instance of an application framework.</p>
<p>From the Ruby on Rails page[1]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that &quot;Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system&quot;. By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>
<li>Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that there is quite a bit of abstraction done right out of the gate to handle the things that are most commonly implemented in websites. If you are coming from a <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a>-oriented background, this amount of abstraction and meta-programming might feel very overwhelming, but the more time you spend learning about it, you'll see that it can be used very effectively for specific types of sites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.[1]</p>
