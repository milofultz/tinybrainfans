<p>If you are working to trade your time and services for money, then working overtime should be you trading your time and services for <em>more</em> money, since you are now giving up your time to recharge, spend time with friends and family, have fun, whatever. This time is <strong>more valuable</strong> because it's what <em>you</em> would choose to do. Ensure you get paid accordingly.</p>
<p>If you <em>can't</em> get paid accordingly and you can say no, <strong>do so</strong>. Your time is valuable, your rest and leisure and fun is valuable, you are valuable.</p>
<h2>Calculating Your Pay</h2>
<p>The commonly agreed on formula for overtime is the overtime multiplier times whatever your wage is. Usually that overtime multiplier is 1.5[1] for every hour over your normal working limit (over 40 hours per week, or whatever your agreement is), with it reaching 2 with more than 8 hours overtime taken per week.</p>
<p>This can be hard for people where your hourly wage is not immediately apparent. Try and reduce down your big yearly wage into units you can use.</p>
<p>Let's start with the desired outcome, assuming we are asked to do one day of overtime and we only know our monthly wage (using $5000 for ease):</p>
<pre><code>overtime multiplier * day&#x27;s wage = day of overtime wages
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to spell out each of these variables, reducing them until we get concrete numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>overtime pay</code> = 1.5</li>
<li><code>day&#x27;s wage</code> = (<code>monthly wage</code> / <code>average number of workdays per month</code>)</li>
<li><code>monthly wage</code> = 5000</li>
<li><code>average number of workdays per month</code> = (365 / 12) * (5 / 7) = 21.72</li>
<li><code>day&#x27;s wage</code> = (5000 / 21.72) = $230</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can fill in the gaps of our original formula:</p>
<pre><code>1.5 * 230 = $345
</code></pre>
