<main id="main"><article id="content"><h1 id="title">Software Maintenance</h1><p>&quot;Go fast and break things&quot; is a common cry of startups and the tech world in general, since hitting the market early will earn you an advantage. Unfortunately what this means about the <em>software</em> is that it's buggy, inaccessible to the differently abled, and difficult or impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>It's our responsibility as developers to stop this kind of behavior as early as possible. This is a disservice to everyone who uses or wants to use a product, and the market at large that will then have to race to the bottom at the expense of those who can't speak up.</p>

<p><strong>Do you see designers as complicit in the conduct of the companies they operate within?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mike Monteiro</strong>: Very, very complicit. All the stuff that Facebook does, all the stuff that Twitter does has to go through a designer at some point. About half of the designers I’ve talked to argue that they’re just a pair of hands doing what they were told to do. With that kind of attitude, I’m not surprised that we’re where we are today.[2]</p>

<h2>CADT Model</h2>
<p>A close relative to this is what Jamie Zawinski calls the &quot;Cascade of Attention-Deficit Teenagers&quot; model[1]. The order is usually the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bugs are found and added to the bug tracker</li>
<li>Many weeks/months/years pass</li>
<li>Bug tickets from step 1 are closed because a new version is being developed</li>
<li>A new version is released without addressing the bugs from step 1</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixing bugs isn't fun; going through the bug list isn't fun; but rewriting everything from scratch <em>is</em> fun (because &quot;this time it will be <em>done right</em>&quot;, ha ha) and so that's what happens, over and over again.[1]</p>
