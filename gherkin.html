<main id="main"><article id="content"><h1 id="title">Gherkin</h1><p>Gherkin is a business readable language which helps you to describe business behavior without going into details of implementation. Built out of Behavior Driven Development[5], the goal is to create a document that can act as a test, the criteria, and the requirements of a feature. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember, behavior scenarios are more than tests – they also represent requirements and acceptance criteria. Good Gherkin comes from good behavior.</p>
<p>The Golden Gherkin Rule: Treat other readers as you would want to be treated. <strong>Write Gherkin so that people who don’t know the feature will understand it.</strong></p>
<p>— Andrew Knight, automationpanda.com[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>NOTE: Gherkin files can actually be used as tests, but I'll be looking at them as mainly a planning and testing tool, so I won't be getting into the software here</em></p>
<p>An example Gherkin feature[3]:</p>
<pre><code class="language-gherkin">Feature: Google Searching

  Scenario: Search from the search bar
    Given a web browser is at the Google home page
    When the user enters &quot;panda&quot; into the search bar
    Then links related to &quot;panda&quot; are shown on the results page

  Scenario: Image search
    Given Google search results for &quot;panda&quot; are shown
    When the user clicks on the &quot;Images&quot; link at the top of the results page
    Then images related to &quot;panda&quot; are shown on the results page
</code></pre>
<p>Each feature of a project can stand by itself and is composed of a standard set of components.</p>
<h2>Feature</h2>
<p>This is the top of your Gherkin file, describing the feature on the <code>Feature</code> line, and an optional description below. The description is essentially a comment containing a <a href="scrum.html">user story</a> regarding that feature. A basic example including a description:</p>
<pre><code class="language-gherkin">Feature: Google Searching
  As a user, I want to search the internet for the information about a given topic, so that I can answer questions or solve problems.
</code></pre>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In a feature that has multiple scenarios with the same <strong>Given</strong> clause, they can be placed inside of this section. THink of it sort of like a <code>beforeEach</code> from something like <a href="jasmine.html">Jasmine</a> or <a href="jest.html">Jest</a> but in plain language.</p>
<pre><code class="language-gherkin">Feature: Google Searching

  Background:
    Given a web browser is at the Google home page

  Scenario: Search from the search bar
    # Given a web browser is at the Google home page
    When the user enters &quot;panda&quot; into the search bar
    Then links related to &quot;panda&quot; are shown on the results page

  Scenario: Searches using I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky
    # Given a web browser is at the Google home page
    When the user enters &quot;panda&quot; into the search bar
    And the user clicks I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky
    Then the web browser navigates to the first search result for &quot;panda&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Each scenario is a self-contained set of tests or requirements that has no bearing on any other scenarios within or outside of a feature.</p>
<pre><code class="language-gherkin">  Scenario: Search from the search bar
    Given a web browser is at the Google home page
    When the user enters &quot;panda&quot; into the search bar
    Then links related to &quot;panda&quot; are shown on the results page
</code></pre>
<h3>Given/When/Then</h3>
<p><strong>Given</strong> sets the stage for the rest of the scenario. It should ensure that a user will incur the same behavior repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> a certain interaction or behavior occurs, <strong>then</strong> a specific outcome is expected (<strong>and</strong> another, <strong>but</strong> not this outcome).</p>
