            <p>Raytracing is a way of generating and rendering 3D graphics for digital images. </p>
<h2>In Layman's Terms</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/02-basic-raytracing.html" target="_blank">Gabriel Gambetta</a>[7]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Y]ou get an insect net. You cut a rectangular piece, frame it, and fix it to a stick. Now you can look at the landscape through a netted window. Next, you choose the best point of view to appreciate this landscape and plant another stick to mark the exact position where your eye should be.</p>
<p>You haven’t started the painting yet, but now you have a fixed point of view and a fixed frame through which you can see the landscape. Moreover, this fixed frame is divided into small squares by the insect net. Now comes the methodical part. You draw a grid on the canvas, giving it the same number of squares as the insect net. Then you look at the top-left square of the net. What’s the predominant color you can see through it? Sky blue. So you paint the top-left square of the canvas sky blue. You do this for every square, and soon enough the canvas contains a pretty good painting of the landscape, as seen through the frame. </p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Place the eye and the frame as desired
For each square on the canvas:
    Determine which square on the frame&#x27;s grid corresponds to this square on the canvas
    Determine the color seen through that grid square
    Paint the square on the canvas with that color

</tbody></table><h2>PGM</h2>
<p>A <strong>portable grayscale map</strong> that is often how raytracing images are rendered. These are usually simple ASCII files containing rows of pixels and their corresponding grayscale values.</p>
<h3>Specification</h3>
<p>There are multiple types of PGM files, but for this we are sticking with <code>P2</code> types, as they are raw ASCII and not binary files, which makes them easy to create.</p>
<p>Every value in the file is separated by a space delimiter of some kind (e.g. space, CR, LF, tab). Comments can be made with a <code>#</code>, with everything following it up to the next newline character being considered part of the comment.</p>
<p>Each file consists of two parts: headers, and the image itself. The header consists of a set of values in order at the beginning of the file. The image consists of a series of values between 0 and your maximum grayscale value. For convenience, it is usually shown with each row being separated by a newline. It is good practice to end your file with a newline.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>PBM (Bit Map)</td>
<td>Monochrome using image values 0 and 1. Uses <code>P1</code> as the type and lacks the third header value re: grayscale value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PPM (Pixel Map)</td>
<td>Color using image value groups of <code>R G B</code>. (e.g. a single pixel can be represented by <code>80 80 40</code>). Uses <code>P3</code> as the type.</td>

<p><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/" target="_blank">Business Card Raytracer</a> - This raytracer was built in <a href="c++.html">C++</a> and fits on the back of a business card as it was all minified. Worth checking out, as it has a lot of impressive ideas and coding feats, along with being a good raytracer in itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/21/tiny-ray-tracer-fits-in-64-bytes/" target="_blank">64b Raycaster</a> - I still don't really know the difference between a raycaster and a raytracer, but either way, this is crazy impressive. <a href="http://twt86.co/#" target="_blank">You can see some raw assembly for a related project here under Wolf64</a>. <a href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=78044" target="_blank">Here it is on Pouet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://zserge.com/posts/raytracer/" target="_blank">Ray tracer for those who skipped the math class</a> - Built with learning how it works in mind. Very helpful going through this to understand what does what.</p>
