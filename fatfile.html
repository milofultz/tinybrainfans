<p>Can I give you consulting math 101? You may already know this, and if so, forgive me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide how much you want to make. Let's use a nice round number. USD$100,000 (Not saying this is your number, yours may be USD$250,000, or whatever. This is just an example.)</li>
<li>Remember to add health insurance, business insurance, error &amp; omission insurance, taxes and fees and everything else. (Call an insurance broker, techinsurance.com, etc.)</li>
<li>Let's call this compiled number USD$150,000. (again, just an example.)</li>
<li>Double it. USD$300,000. You can expect no more than 50% utilization, and you have to spend time finding the next client/gig/opportunity. So you will only make half a years worth of hourly salary.</li>
<li>Convert to hourly. There are 2080 working hours in a year. So you can have a vacation, call it 2000. Divide 300,000 by 2,000. That's 150. So your hourly rate is $150/hour.</li>
<li>If you are 50% utilized, you will make USD$150,000 per year. With six months of time to find work, have a vacation, keep your certs alive, and expand your skill set.</li>
</ul>

</article><article><h1><a href="glue-work.html">Glue Work</a></h1>
<p>[0:10:32] Glue work is the meta work that helps keep the organization running and on track. e.g. scrum master stuff; fixing problems, increasing fluidity in between teams, creating coding standards for ease of production, etc.</p>
<p>[0:12:12] If you are only doing glue work and not your actual job, it may be beneficial but it is hurting your own career and potentially your ability to keep your job or get promoted.</p>
<p>[0:14:31] What do you want to get better at? Do more of that and get better at it. Find something that you will be happy and proud to do. When we start at a job, we are bad and then get better.</p>
<p>[0:18:30] Since certain fields just assume if you left a certain job you lost all of those skills, which of those doors are you willing to close to open some others?</p>
<p>[0:19:43] Have the career conversation with the boss about &quot;when will I be promoted&quot;, &quot;What do I need to do to do so&quot;, etc. Write them down for later.</p>
<p>[0:20:17] If you find yourself doing a whole lot of X, get a title that shows that you do X a lot.</p>
<p>[0:21:23] Create a story that shows that &quot;because of the work X I did, Y was able to happen. It happened because of the work I did.&quot;</p>
<p>[0:22:22] If your colleagues, managers, etc. do not care about the glue work you are doing, stop doing it and only do what is on your job description. If your goal is to get promoted, a raise, etc. and what you need to get those promotions is not being done, focus only on your job description and achieving those goals until that goal is achieved. Push away requests that are not your problem. [0:23:20] Do not catch things that are about to drop. Do not try and fix what is broken. It is not your problem if they are not willing to reward you for your work.</p>
<p>[0:24:07] How are you spending your finite work hours? If it is not on the things that are bringing you towards your goals, be it happiness, a promotion, or whatever, do not do those things. Focus only on what you need. [0:24:46] You will only learn what you spend time on, so learn deliberately and spend time on the things that will reward you most. [0:25:26] Be public about learning and let people know what you've been working on. [0:26:02] Don't take learning opportunities from others if you know how; give them the work that will help them learn.</p>
<p>[0:26:25] &quot;You should do X because you are so good at it.&quot; &quot;Yes I am good at whatever I spend a lot of time on, you should see me doing Y.&quot;</p>

<h2>Solving big problems is just solving problems</h2>
<p>Solving problems is the <strong>ability to break problems into smaller problems</strong>. Even if you don't instantly know how to solve it, and say &quot;well, I'm probably going to need to do X and then Y&quot;, and can <strong>repeat that process for those sub-problems until you either know how to solve it, look it up, or ask someone</strong>.</p>
<h2>Aptitude is more important than knowledge</h2>
<p><strong>The common thing to confuse &quot;aptitude&quot; with is &quot;knowledge&quot;</strong>.  I also talk about this when discussing interviewing with colleagues: many interviews check for &quot;knowledge&quot; (what does this function do? what is a hash? what does &quot;<a href="css.html">CSS</a>&quot; stand for?) because it's easy to do and (presumably) because people mistakenly consider it a good heuristic for whatever makes someone a good developer.  However, in general, <strong>&quot;knowledge&quot; is easy to get</strong> - go read wikipedia or a book or some documentation and memorize it.  <strong>It's also not very useful</strong> - if you don't know something, go look it up!  It helps because it makes you faster (not having to look everything up is why CPUs have instruction caches), and it might more quickly lead you toward a better solution (if you know several approaches already, you can more quickly consider which would be best), but much more important is &quot;aptitude&quot;.  <strong>It's much harder to teach someone how to think</strong>.</p>

<h2>Commits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add files you want to commit: <code>git add {file or folder name}</code> or <code>git add .</code></li>
<li>
Add only portions of a file as 'hunks': <code>git add --patch/-p {file or folder name}</code>. This will prompt you with options:<ul>
<li>y - stage this hunk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>n - do not stage this hunk</li>
<li>q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones</li>
<li>a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file</li>
<li>d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file</li>
<li>g - select a hunk to go to</li>
<li>/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex</li>
<li>j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk</li>
<li>J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk</li>
<li>k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk</li>
<li>K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk</li>
<li>s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks</li>
<li>e - <a href="https://rietta.com/blog/git-patch-manual-split/" target="_blank">manually edit the current hunk</a> (particularly if your code is really close together but needs to be broken down)</li>
<li>? - print help</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Branches</h2>
<ul>
<li>See all branches: <code>git branch</code></li>
<li>See the remote branches your local repo knows: <code>git branch -a</code></li>
<li>Checkout an existing branch: <code>git checkout {name}</code></li>
<li>Create and name a new branch: <code>git branch {name}</code></li>
<li>Create and checkout a new branch: <code>git checkout -b {name}</code></li>
<li>Create an orphaned branch: <code>git checkout --orphan {branch_name}</code></li>
<li>Push the current branch: <code>git push origin HEAD</code></li>
<li>Rename a branch. Assuming you're currently on the branch you want to rename: <code>git branch -m {name}</code></li>
<li>
Merge a branch (source) into another branch (destination):<ul>
<li>Commit all changes in source branch</li>
<li>Checkout destination branch</li>
<li><code>git merge {source-branch}</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete a fully pushed and merged branch: <code>git branch -d {name}</code></li>
<li>Force delete a local branch: <code>git branch -D {name}</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Orphan Branches</h3>
<p>Commits usually have one parent, their previous iteration. The root commit (very beginning) of your repo has none, and when you merge commit a fork with another branch or the master branch.</p>
<p>An orphan branch is a new root commit, where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first commit made on this new branch will have no parents, and it will be the root of a new history, totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits. In other words, it creates a new root commit and uses it as a starting point for your new branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Delete All Merged Branches</h3>
<p>To delete all branches that have been merged, start out by pulling from remote to ensure you are using the most up to date info. Then check which branches are merged by running <code>git branch --merged</code>. We will be using <code>egrep</code> to grab these and put them into a macro that will delete each merged branch that doesn't fit within the regex. To ensure a branch that contains a certain keyword does not get deleted, add it to the <code>egrep -v &quot;(^...)&quot;</code> line, with each keyword separated by an OR <code>|</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch --merged <span class="p">|</span> egrep -v <span class="s2">&quot;(^\*|master|main|dev|staging)&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> xargs git branch -d
</pre></div>
<h2>Cherry Pick</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When should I use cherry-pick? <strong>The short answer is: as rarely as possible.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cherry picking</p>
<h2>Revert</h2>
<p>A revert allows you to go back to a previous commit, reversing those previous between commit X (HEAD) and commit Y(the selected commit). This will create a reversal commit for each commit to be undone between X and Y. In the case of a single commit to be undone, it will make a single reversal commit.</p>
<p>To revert one or many commits, open your <code>git log</code> and find the commit you want to revert back to. Save this hash.</p>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag is used to revert a merge; to set where the mainline is, which parent you are wanting to revert back to. Most of the time it is 1. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git revert <span class="o">[</span>-m <span class="m">1</span><span class="o">]</span> &lt;commit-hash&gt;
</pre></div>
<h2>Stashing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-stash-explained/" target="_blank">Stashing</a> allows you to temporarily save changes without committing anything. </p>
<p>To stash some changes, use <code>git stash save &#x27;message about stash&#x27;</code>, or just <code>git stash</code> if you want to leave out the message.</p>
<p>To see what you have stashed, use <code>git stash list</code> to see all stashed code. Then see what is in each stash by using <code>git stash show {index}</code>, and you can see it diffed by using the <code>-p</code> flag.</p>
<p>Stashes can be listed recalled via the indexes shown: <code>git stash apply {index}</code> or <code>git stash pop {index}</code> if you want to remove it from the stashes after being applied.</p>
<p>You can <code>git stash drop {index}</code> individual stashes or <code>git stash clear</code> the entire stash.</p>
<h2>Git Aliases</h2>
<h3>Flags</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>--global</code> will set the alias across your whole machine</li>
<li><code>--unset</code> will unset the following alias</li>
<li><code>--unset-all</code> will unset all of the aliases found at the following alias</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>shell&gt; git config --global alias.co checkout <span class="c1"># now &#39;git co&#39; is aliased to &#39;git checkout&#39;</span>
shell&gt; git config alias.p <span class="s1">&#39;push origin HEAD&#39;</span>  <span class="c1"># now &#39;git p&#39; is aliased to &#39;git push origin HEAD&#39; ONLY for current project</span>
shell&gt; git config --global --unset alias.p <span class="c1"># now &#39;git p&#39; is no longer aliased</span>
</pre></div>
<h2><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore" target="_blank">Gitignore</a></h2>
<p>Creating a <code>.gitignore</code> file in the root folder of your project will ensure every file that matches a line within the file will be ignored by git.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a <code>*</code> will work as a wildcard for every file within that level of the given directory, or as a wildcard within a filename.</li>
<li>Using two <code>**</code> in the filepath will look within every level recursively from that point forward. e.g. <code>**/.DS_Store</code> will find a file called <code>.DS_Store</code> in the root directory as well as any others in any folders within that root directory. <code>lib/**/__pycache__</code> will match any files or folders named <code>__pycache__</code> that are within the <code>lib</code> directory at any depth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global gitignore</h3>
<p>You can ignore files globally by adding them to <code>~/.gitignore_global</code>. </p>
<h3><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository" target="_blank">Delete previous files in gitignore</a></h3>
<p>If you add a file to <code>.gitignore</code> after previously committing that file, you may see untracked changes on those files. You have to remove the old files from the git repository to remove that error.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the existing files: <code>find . -name {filename} -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch</code></li>
<li>Add the file to the gitignore: <code>{filename}</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Credentials</h2>
<p>If you receive a message like this when trying to push up to your repo:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">remote</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">HTTP</span> <span class="n">Basic</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Access</span> <span class="n">denied</span>
<span class="n">fatal</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Authentication</span> <span class="n">failed</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://gitlab.com/myusername/repo.git&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">remote</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Invalid</span> <span class="n">username</span> <span class="n">or</span> <span class="n">password</span><span class="o">.</span>
<span class="n">fatal</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Authentication</span> <span class="n">failed</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://github.com/milofultz/tod.git/&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Then you may have revoked or renewed your token and need to reset it. To do so, type this in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git credential reject
</pre></div>
<p>And when you receive a new line, enter in <code>url=</code> followed by the url that showed up previously in the error message. Then use ctrl-c or ctrl-d to quit.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>url=https://github.com/milofultz/tod.git/
</pre></div>
<p>On trying to push again, you will get prompted for authentication and it will work.</p>

</article><article><h1>Best Practices (Programming)</h1>
<h2>Writing Code</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Programming isn't about the stack</strong> or the systems architecture; the arch meta will change faster than you can learn it.</li>
<li>The number of frontend Frameworks out there are N+1.</li>
<li><strong>DRY, recursive funcs, polymorphism are [typically] afterthoughts and should not be a goal while you're developing the solution.</strong></li>
<li>TAKE TIME OFF. <strong>If you have 24 hrs time off that's three days office time. TAKE. THEM. AND. GO. AFK</strong>. It's best to plan the time and let your team know. Try to make it non-work related (but not self-destructive): camping, reading, visit family, practice hobbies, volunteering with animal shelters, study fine art, date people .... Make memories. Please, just live your life.</li>
<li><strong>Understand what good testing means.</strong> If you have trouble with this, look at tests on github of frameworks/languages. The basic form of tests come in the following for Javascript for front/back end devs (Node.js specific?): Unit Tests, Integration Tests, End-to-end tests. <strong>Understand why they're utilized and how to leverage them for various use-cases.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Read the documentation. It's your job to understand what's going on internally</strong> for your stack's framework(s) and if it takes you a few days to estimate the work-cost of utilizing a new lib reading docs is time well spent. If management doesn't understand this time after time then look for a new place to work.</li>
<li>Buy you a whiteboard. Plan your work on it - sprints, logic, component relationships, cat drawings. (and of course it doesn't have to be a whiteboard, but the open space of a whiteboard to track my weekly meetings, logic intuitions, etc. all are best expressed for me in a large space)</li>
<li><strong>Keep a journal</strong> if you can (or a blog/vlog/written notes if that's the way you track your thoughts). <strong>Reflecting on the way I thought about a problem or feature set has been the best way for me to recognize my growth.</strong> (e.g. In college we never really discussed the implications of &quot;Immutability&quot; though it was mentioned and I found that as I kept journaling my understandings of Immutability with the context of the problems at hand it helped to give me a portrait of how/when to utilize it for future projects more effectively.)</li>
<li>&quot;Make it correct, make it clear, make it concise, make it fast. In that order.&quot; - Wes Dyer</li>
<li>&quot;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&quot; - Abelson &amp; Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Job/Soft Skills</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The job of a programmer on a team is to communicate</strong>. You will not get a better application from all-nighters, you will not 'free solo' an application. All systems are the sum total of the discussions, joint planning, and hard work. Any product you concoct alone, devoid of communication, will fail in a team-based env. (though, shared all-nighters in a team session have been some of the best moments in my career, so take this one with a pinch of salt)</li>
<li>Few tho they are, <strong>programming &quot;rock stars&quot; exist</strong>: you will see them on NPM and may even work beside them or read their blog posts, but <strong>these are outliers</strong>. (Read &quot;Outliers&quot; by Malcom Gladwell for better context than I can provide). I had the opportunity of working with an &quot;Outlier&quot; and though my understanding of programing appreciated from that time, the codebase suffered (and still suffers) from it.</li>
<li>Kanban's will keep your team in check. <strong>Stay on top of your tracking especially if your portion is behind</strong>; it's not a mechanism of doubt or shame or illness or anything that contributed to you being behind on work. <strong>Your honesty is tantamount</strong>: when your peers start to doubt your abilities you're already in a bigger hole than you probably are. <strong>Learn to communicate the nature of your issues with the problem at hand</strong> and I guarantee that your peers will recognize it if not in whole than in part. Speak up!</li>
<li>Tell your boss to have patience. But first, learn how to tell your boss to have patience.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint estimations for new features are, in the practical sense, a fallacy</strong>. Feature-sprints are pretty loose unless you work with a team that's one-out-of-a-thousand. Pad your dates by a factor of 2 where you can. (2 months = 4 months, etc. - also depends on your team size.)</li>
<li><strong>If your team consistently underestimates the time needed</strong> for a patch/feature (sprints) after 1.5/1.75 yrs time <strong>consider leaving</strong> unless you (or management) can really commit to change in this regard.</li>
<li>&quot;<a href="glue-work.html">Glue Work</a>.&quot; <strong>In the scope of dev, there are no enemies.</strong> Not your boss's boss, not your boss, not your team members, not your clients, not you. <strong>Company culture is usually your first culprit if things go wrong</strong>, and if you can't vocalize why/how then it requires one of two things: a contractor to debug your company culture OR for you to leave; there is (in my experience) no middle ground here. (Unless it's your job to fix it, at least learn how to recognize Glue Work: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KClAPipnKqw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KClAPipnKqw</a>)</li>
<li>If you work for a non profit, make sure your worldview is in line with the org's mission statement and that those you work with harbor your own sentiments. If not, leave.</li>
<li><strong>Do not interview for new jobs with/on company property or during work hours.</strong> Even if you have consent to do so, just don't. Wait until lunch, wait until you're home to compose your email resp to an offer. Cover your bases legally especially in the realm of startups.</li>
<li>When looking for jobs, ask about their testing practices. If they don't really answer, obfuscate their response, or just dont have an answer, avoid them at all costs. <strong>Tests/testing are a symptom of a healthy company culture.</strong></li>
<li>Learn/Practice vocalizing thoughts such as &quot;I think you're wrong, here's why...&quot; and &quot;I don't think that's right given ...&quot; and &quot;While that's part of the problem an equally (if not more) pressing issue is ...&quot; It's important to <strong>learn how to vocalize your misgivings, even if you're not 100% confident about them</strong>; your intuitions about a given problem will usually find similar minds on the team chip-in and fill the gaps.</li>
<li>Empathy. Empathy for your co-workers, empathy for your clients, empathy for your past-self too. <strong>Practice empathy.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Self Development</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make a habit of <strong>reading books if not directly related to dev then tangentially related</strong>. (4 books per year was a good pace for me.)</li>
</ul>

<p>SVG's are scalable vector graphics. They consist of instructions for the computer to follow to create the drawing.</p>
<p>An SVG file is an <a href="xml.html">XML</a> markup file and thus is super simple to create yourself. All SVG's start out with an outer <code>svg</code> element.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;svg</span> <span class="na">version=</span><span class="s">&quot;1.1&quot;</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;300&quot;</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;200&quot;</span> <span class="na">viewBox=</span><span class="s">&quot;x1 y1 x2 y2&quot;</span> <span class="na">xmlns=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- Version is not necessary --&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- W/H set during render, can be overwritten via CSS --&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- Viewbox is the part of grid to be shown  --&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- xmlns is required only for SVG files, not inline HTML --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Drawing Shapes and Paths</h2>
<p>SVG's use a grid system, where positive X is <strong>right</strong> and positive Y is <strong>down</strong>. The top left of the document is then <code>0, 0</code>.</p>
<p>By default, renderings that come first, are placed below renderings that come later.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;svg</span> <span class="err">...</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;rect</span> <span class="err">...</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;</span>      // Behind the circle
  <span class="nt">&lt;circle</span> <span class="err">...</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;</span>  // On top of the rect
<span class="nt">&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can group SVG elements in a <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> container, and all transformations made on the container will occur to their children.</p>
<h3>Path</h3>
<p>The <code>path</code> element is how you &quot;pick up&quot; and &quot;put down&quot; your &quot;pen&quot;, as well as draw the lines which can make up a filled shape or just a stroked line. The directions go within the <code>d</code> attribute.</p>
<p><code>M x y</code> is when you place your pen a given position without a stroke. <code>L x y</code>is when you draw a line to (x,y) from your starting point.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">&lt;!-- This will move the pen to (0, 10) and draw a line to (10, 0) in the given box --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">&quot;M 0 10 L 10 0&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/path&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Shapes</h3>
<p>Rectangles are drawn with the <code>rect</code> element.</p>
<p>Circles are drawn with the <code>circle</code> element, with a center X/Y and a radius.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;circle</span> <span class="na">cx=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span> <span class="na">cy=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span> <span class="na">r=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Other polygons are drawn with the <code>polygon</code> element and a series of <code>X,Y</code> points separated by spaces.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;polygon</span> <span class="na">points=</span><span class="s">&quot;0,100 50,25 50,75 100,0&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>External file or inline <a href="html.html">HTML</a>?</h2>
<p>External files allow the computer to only have to load the data once and then reuse it throughout the page. If you have it written out multiple times, that is a lot of extra work.</p>

<p>Regular Expressions or &quot;regex&quot; is used to describe a series of characters. If it has a pattern in its formatting, regex can be used.</p>
<h2>Regular Expression Syntax</h2>
<p>This syntax is for <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a>, but it is mostly what I have used in everything so far.</p>
<h3>Metacharacters</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>^</code> at the beginning means that the match must start with what follows. </li>
<li><code>$</code> at the end means that the match must end with what precedes it.</li>
<li><code>.</code> means any character that is in that place is allowed. e.g. <code>/h.llo/</code> will return a match on &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hallo&quot;, &quot;hullo&quot;, etc.</li>
<li><code>*</code> means match the preceding character or group 0 or more times.</li>
<li><code>+</code> means match the preceding character or group 1 or more times.</li>
<li><code>?</code> means the preceding character is optional in the match. (e.g. <code>/gre?a?y/</code> matches 'grey', 'gray', and 'gry')</li>
<li><code>+?</code> means match as few instances of the preceding character or group as possible.</li>
<li><code>x|y</code> means x or y.</li>
<li><code>\</code> is used to escape characters.</li>
<li><code>[abc]</code> means one of the characters within the brackets ('a' 'b' or 'c') must be present at that position. This can include one or more ranges of characters, which are notated with a hyphen (e.g. 'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9'). Adding a <code>^</code> within the brackets means anything <em>but</em> what is inside. </li>
<li><code>x{n}</code> returns a match if a <code>x</code> is found <code>n</code> number of times. <code>n</code> can be a range separated by a comma (e.g. <code>{2,4}</code>). A single comma and nothing succeeding it means at least <code>n</code> times (e.g. <code>{2,}</code> means at least 2 times).</li>
<li><code>()</code> indicate that whatever is within them should be grouped together, in instances of curly braces for instance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shorthand Character Classes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>\w</code> is any alphanumeric char or underscore.</li>
<li><code>\W</code> is anything <em>but</em> an alphanumeric char or underscore.</li>
<li><code>\d</code> is any digit.</li>
<li><code>\D</code> is anything <em>but</em> a digit.</li>
<li><code>\s</code> is any whitespace character.</li>
<li><code>\S</code> is any non-whitespace character.</li>
<li><code>\b</code> denotes a word boundary. Placed after a string of chars, it matches if the string is found and is succeeded by anything but an alphanum or underscore.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lookahead and Lookbehind</h3>
<p>Lookahead and lookbehind allow search queries that will not be included in the final match. e.g. <code>x(?=y)</code> will return <code>x</code> <em>only if</em> succeeded by <code>y</code>.</p>
<h4>Lookahead</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>x(?=y)</code> will match <code>x</code> only if it is followed by <code>y</code>.</li>
<li><code>x(?!y)</code> will match <code>x</code> only if it is <em>not</em> followed by <code>y</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lookbehind</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>(?&lt;=y)x</code> will match <code>x</code> only if it is preceded by <code>y</code>.</li>
<li><code>(?&lt;!y)x</code> will match <code>x</code> only if it is <em>not</em> preceded by <code>y</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flags/Suffixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>i</code> means the preceding search is case insensitive. If <code>i</code> is absent, it is case sensitive.</li>
<li><code>g</code> means it will search for all instances, not just the first one it finds.</li>
<li><code>m</code> means multiline search</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backreferences</h3>
<p><code>\1</code>, where <code>1</code> is any incremental number, is called a <a href="https://regular-expressions.mobi/backref.html?wlr=1" target="_blank">backreference</a>. The number is referring to the capture group of the current reg ex. When called, the regex will search for the <em>exact instance found</em> of that regex. </p>
<p>For example, <code>/[A-Z][0-9]\1/</code> will search for any char between A-Z, 0-9, and whatever character was found in the first character group. If you were searching through 'A9A' it would be a success, while 'A9B' would fail. This is because capture group <code>1</code> found an 'A', and therefore the backreference (<code>\1</code>) must also find an 'A'.</p>

<p>Express is a <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a>-based <a href="server.html">server</a> application that will help route requests from the client.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>First, start your project with <code>npm init</code> in the project folder. Then <code>npm i express</code>. Now you can start implementing the barebones in your project.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// app.js</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">express</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;express&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">port</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">3000</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">port</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sb">`Listening on port </span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nx">port</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To get it running, set up your <code>package.json</code> with a script to run. You can also use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon" target="_blank" title="Nodemon is essential for developing your own apps">nodemon</a> to run and restart upon file changes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;start&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;node app.js&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;dev&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;nodemon app.js&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Upon running one of these scripts (<code>npm run start/dev</code>), you should see a message in your terminal that your app is listening on port 3000.</p>
<h2>Routes</h2>

<p>React is a <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> framework for implementing dynamic single page applications into your site.</p>
<h2>Setting Up</h2>
<p>Use <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank">create-react-app</a> with <a href="npm.html">npm</a> or <a href="react-from-scratch.html">build it from scratch</a>.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Components are reusable pieces of <a href="jsx.html">JSX</a> that can be used to dynamically render HTML. The JSX is written as is, outside of any quotes. When components are referenced, they are written with the closing <code>/</code>. Components are named in PascalCase. </p>
<p><strong>Note the parentheses used in the arrow function instead of curly braces.</strong> This is because the implicit return will enclose everything within the parentheses and allow it to be placed on multiple lines.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>const FoodItem = () =&gt; (
  <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Get some of this food!<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
);

const GroceryList = () =&gt; (
  <span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;FoodItem</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;FoodItem</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
);
</pre></div>
<p>These are rendered via the render method of the <code>ReactDOM</code>, which takes the component followed by the destination it will be appended to. Most common is that you will have a single div that your whole website will be injected into, i.e. <code>&lt;div class=&quot;app&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ReactDOM.render(&lt;GroceryList /&gt;, document.getElementById(&#39;main&#39;));
</pre></div>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">&lt;!-- output in associated HTML file --&gt;</span>

<h4>Component Properties, or Props</h4>
<p>Properties are attributes that can be passed into and used to populate parts of that component. Props are always passed in as an object of keys that correspond to the attributes given on the JSX element. e.g. <code>&lt;Component name={&quot;John&quot;} age={6} /&gt;</code> will pass <code>{ name: &quot;John&quot;, age: 6 }</code> into the <code>Component</code>. Props are surrounded by curly braces when they are assigned and when they are recalled. Inside the curly braces, valid <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> may be called.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>const GroceryListItem = (props) =&gt; (

<h4>PropTypes</h4>
<p>You can add type checking to your props to make your code a bit more robust. If the types you entered don't match the element's type, then it will only give a warning in the console and will still render (as long as it is able).</p>
<p>Primitive types in PropTypes:</p>
<ul>
<li>array</li>
<li>bool</li>
<li>func</li>
<li>number</li>
<li>object</li>
<li>string</li>
<li>symbol</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also specify <code>.isRequired</code> at the end of your propType definition.</p>

<h4>Exporting Components</h4>
<p>You can put the component into another file and import it in by using the <code>export default componentName</code> syntax.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>// GroceryListItem.js
const GroceryListItem = (props) =&gt; (
  <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>{props.item.toUpperCase()}<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<h3>User Interaction/Event Listeners</h3>
<p>Components can have local event listeners assigned directly to themselves.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>const GroceryListItem = (props) =&gt; {
  const onListItemClick = function (e) {
    console.log(&quot;Yum!&quot;);
  };
  
  return (
    <span class="nt">&lt;li</span> <span class="na">onClick=</span><span class="s">{onListItemClick}</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>{props.item}<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
  )
};
</pre></div>
<p>If you want to use an event listener on a class component that will be used within another <code>this</code> context, you need to be sure you maintain the correct <code>this</code>, either through <code><a href="apply,-call-and-bind-in-javascript.html">bind</a></code>, or the more sexy use of an anonymous arrow function.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>// Good
return (
  <span class="nt">&lt;li</span> <span class="na">onClick=</span><span class="s">{this.onListItemClick.bind(this)}</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>{props.item}<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
)

// Better
return (
  <span class="nt">&lt;li</span> <span class="na">onClick=</span><span class="s">{()</span> <span class="err">=</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> this.onListItemClick()}&gt;{props.item}<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
)
</pre></div>
<h3>Stateless Functional vs. Class</h3>
<p>All of the previous examples have used stateless functional components, which are declared at runtime and essentially become a static web page. If you want to have user interaction and a dynamic webpage, you will want to include <strong>state</strong>. State is just a dynamic memory for a given component, e.g. whether it has been clicked or has a given property. State is only included on class components and is initialized in the constructor.</p>
<p>First you will want to convert your stateless functional component into a class component.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">GroceryListItem</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="n">React</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Component</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">constructor</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">props</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">props</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="n">render</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
      <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">props</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Then you can add your <strong>state</strong> to the element via the class. When <code>this.setState</code> is called, the element rerenders in the <a href="dom.html">DOM</a>, applying whatever changes you have made to the state and control flow of the rendering of the element.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">GroceryListItem</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="n">React</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Component</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">constructor</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">props</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">props</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="n">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="n">hover</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">false</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="n">onClick</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setState</span><span class="p">({</span>
      <span class="n">hover</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hover</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="n">render</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">style</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="n">fontWeight</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hover</span> <span class="err">?</span> <span class="s2">&quot;bold&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;normal&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
      <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">li</span> <span class="n">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">style</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">onClick</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onClick</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">this</span><span class="p">)}</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">props</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For the element to properly rerender, you must update the state by using the <code>setState</code> method. This will cause what React calls &quot;reconciliation&quot;, which will update what needs to be updated in the <a href="dom.html">DOM</a>.</p>

<p>This design pattern is used to separate functionality, logic, and component management. MVC can feel or seem confusing because there is not one way to do it, and many different frameworks that utilize MVC do it differently from one another.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>The model is the <strong>brain</strong> of the application, responsible for getting and manipulating the data. It is often interacting with some kind of <a href="database.html">database</a> or data in a file.</p>
<p>The model is often communicating with the <strong>controller</strong>, which is requesting data and/or updating the <strong>view</strong>. Sometimes the updating of the view is delegated to the model, sometimes to the controller.</p>
<h3>View</h3>
<p>This is what the user interacts with. In web development, this is usually made up of <a href="html.html">HTML</a> and <a href="css.html">CSS</a>.</p>
<p>The view is usually told what to show by the <strong>controller</strong> by being given dynamic values, usually with some kind of template engine, like <a href="handlebars.html">Handlebars</a>, ERV, HAML, <a href="jinja2.html">Jinja2</a>, etc.</p>
<h3>Controller</h3>
<p>The controller takes in user input and decides what to do with it. Usually the user interaction with the browser will go through some kind of <strong>router</strong> which will then give the controller a specific method to execute.</p>
<p>The controller acts as a middleman between the <strong>controller</strong> and the <strong>view</strong>. It takes the user input, passes it to the <strong>model</strong> which will then return some data to the controller, who then tells the <strong>view</strong> what to display to the user.</p>

<p>Magic numbers are numbers that have no semantic meaning within the program. These are problematic for maintenance and bug fixing since somebody reading the code later could have no idea what exactly the numbers represent.</p>

<h2>Contrast</h2>
<p>There needs to be a contrast of at LEAST 4.5:1 between the background and foreground of colors for readability. </p>
<p>&quot;In WCAG 2, contrast is a measure of the difference in perceived &quot;luminance&quot; or brightness between two colors (the phrase &quot;color contrast&quot; is never used). This brightness difference is expressed as a ratio ranging from 1:1 (e.g. white on white) to 21:1 (e.g., black on a white).&quot;</p>

<section><h2>Backlinks:</h2><ul><li><a href="test-driven-development.html">Test-Driven Development</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h1><a href="test-driven-development.html">Test-Driven Development</a></h1>
<p>In <a href="programming.html">programming</a>, test-driven development is when tests are developed first before the code is written. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In test-driven development the mantra has always been, red, green, refactor. Write a failing test and run it (red), make the test pass (green), then refactor it (that is look at the code and see if you can make it any better).[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can’t write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.</li>
<li>You can’t write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.</li>
<li>You can’t write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>Write the test that forces you to write the code you already know you want to write. </p>
<p>Avoid the central behaviors as long as possible. Don't go for the gold right away. </p>
<p>Decouple the production code from the test code by ensuring your tests are not 1:1 for the class methods or functions. Create and refactor as you go in production, but allow the tests to remain.</p>
<h2>Why Use TDD</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your code will ALWAYS be working just a second ago when you last tested.</li>
<li>It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping" target="_blank">double-entry bookkeeping</a> for development.</li>
<li>A test suite that you don't trust is worthless. A test suite that does not allow you to make a decision when it passes is useless. There can be NO HOLES.</li>

<p><code>grep</code> finds string patterns within a given file or folder.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ grep PATTERN dir/file.name
$ grep <span class="s1">&#39;THIS THAT&#39;</span> dir/file.name
</pre></div>
<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
<p><strong>Square brackets</strong> do the same as normal, and also includes special POSIX groups, that do what you assume: <code>[:alnum:]</code>, <code>[:alpha:]</code>, <code>[:blank:]</code>, <code>[:cntrl:]</code>, <code>[:digit:]</code>, <code>[:graph:]</code>, <code>[:lower:]</code>, <code>[:print:]</code>, <code>[:punct:]</code>, <code>[:space:]</code>, <code>[:upper:]</code>, and <code>[:xdigit:]</code>.</p>
<h2>Search with OR, AND, NOT</h2>
<h3>OR</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ grep <span class="s1">&#39;PATTERN1\|PATTERN2&#39;</span> dir/file.name
</pre></div>
<h3>AND</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ grep PATTERN1 dir/file.name <span class="p">|</span> grep PATTERN2
</pre></div>
<h3>NOT</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ grep -v <span class="s1">&#39;NOTPATTERN&#39;</span> dir/file.name
</pre></div>
<h3>Chain together a NOT with a regular search</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ grep <span class="s1">&#39;THIS&#39;</span> dir/file.name <span class="p">|</span> grep -v <span class="s2">&quot;NOT THIS&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>Options with a single hyphen can be combined and placed after <code>grep</code>. Double hyphen options are separated.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ grep -rin PATTERN file.diz
</pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>-r</code>: search recursively within a folder</li>
<li><code>-i</code>: ignore case of search pattern</li>
<li><code>-n</code>: print line number where pattern is found</li>
<li><code>-h</code>: suppress filename from output</li>
<li><code>--color</code>: color the output where pattern is found</li>
<li><code>--include=GLOB</code>: search only files whose base name matches GLOB using wildcard matching (e.g. <code>$ grep --include=*.md PATTERN</code>)</li>
<li><code>--exclude-dir=dir_name</code> or <code>--exclude-dir={multiple,dir_names}</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Output Formatting</h2>
<p>You can use <code>awk</code> to print out a formatted output. <code>-F</code> and the following char is where in the string <code>awk</code> will split. Each split section can be called using $NF, with NF being the number of the field we want. $0 is everything.</p>

<h2>Basic Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>cp [-r] ./source ./destination</code> - Copy file or directory <code>[-r]</code> from source to destination</li>
<li><code>mv [-r] ./source ./destination</code> - Move/rename file or directory <code>[-r]</code> from source to destination</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/run-bash-commands-background-linux/" target="_blank">Background Tasks</a></h2>
<p>You can run tasks in the background within a <a href="terminal.html">terminal</a> window by placing an <code>&amp;</code> at the end of the command you want running. You can see these background jobs with <code>jobs</code> and kill the job that you want with <code>kill %</code> followed by the index, or just <code>kill %</code> to kill all jobs.</p>
<h2>Event Designators</h2>
<p>An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the  history list.  Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative  to the current position in the history list.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$_</code> Repeat the last argument used, e.g. <code>mkdir folder-name &amp;&amp; cd &quot;$_&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>!!</code> Repeats the previous command</li>
<li><code>!10</code> Repeat the 10th command from the history</li>
<li><code>!-2</code> Repeat the 2nd command (from the last) from the history</li>
<li><code>!string</code> Repeat the command that starts with “string” from the history</li>
<li><code>!?string</code> Repeat the command that contains the word “string” from the history</li>
<li><code>^str1^str2^</code> Substitute str1 in the previous command with str2 and execute it</li>
<li><code>!!:$</code> Gets the last argument from the previous command.</li>
<li><code>!string:n</code> Gets the nth argument from the command that starts with “string” from the history.</li>
<li><code>!^</code> first argument of the previous command</li>
<li><code>!$</code> last argument of the previous command</li>
<li><code>!*</code> all arguments of the previous command</li>
<li><code>!:2</code> second argument of the previous command</li>
<li><code>!:2-3</code> second to third arguments of the previous command</li>
<li><code>!:2-$</code> second to last arguments of the previous command</li>
<li><code>!:2*</code> second to last arguments of the previous command</li>
<li><code>!:2-</code> second to next to last arguments of the previous command</li>
<li><code>!:0</code> the command itself</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aliases</h2>
<p>WIthin your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file, add this line and populate it how you need:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">alias</span> <span class="nv">alias_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;command_to_run&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># e.g.</span>
<span class="nb">alias</span> <span class="nv">poo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;say &#39;I have to poop really bad&#39;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When complete, run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> or <code>source ~/.zshrc</code> and restart bash to have them take effect.</p>
<h2>Pipe</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To connect the STDOUT of one <strong>command</strong> to the STDIN of <strong>another</strong> use the | symbol, commonly known as a pipe.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># long way</span>
$ thing1 &gt; tempfile
$ thing2 &lt; tempfile

<span class="c1"># shorter</span>
$ thing1 &gt; tempfile <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> thing2 &lt; tempfile

<span class="c1"># shortest</span>
$ thing1 <span class="p">|</span> thing2
</pre></div>
<h2>Base64</h2>
<p><code>base64 path/to/file &gt; output.txt</code> will encode whatever file into base64. </p>
<p><code>echo -n &#x27;some string&#x27; | base64 &gt; output.txt</code> will encode a string as input and not encode unusable chars, like line feeds.</p>
<p>The <code>--decode</code> flag may be added to reverse this process.</p>

<p>SQL is a Structured Query Language that uses a relational <a href="database.html">database</a>. A relational database represents a collection of related 2D tables, like spreadsheet. <strong>Tables</strong> of information about a certain thing hold <strong>rows</strong> that are specific instances of that thing with <strong>columns</strong> that show shared characteristics of those instances.</p>
<p><strong>Database schemas</strong> describe the structure of each table and the datatypes that each column can contain.</p>
<h2>Basic Syntax Rules</h2>
<p>The end of a query is denoted with a semicolon. </p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong> are made with <code>--</code>. </p>
<p><strong>Whitespace</strong> and line returns are optional but often added for readability.</p>
<p>SQL queries are <strong>case insensitive</strong>, but by convention, the SQL commands and keywords are place in all capital letters to be easier to read by humans.</p>
<h2>Creating/Using Databases</h2>
<p>First, you want to see what databases exist using the <strong>SHOW DATABASES</strong> keyword.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SHOW</span> <span class="k">DATABASES</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We will use the <strong>CREATE DATABASE</strong> keyword to initialize a database. TO enter into the database</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">DATABASE</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">USE</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>CREATE TABLE / IF NOT EXISTS</h3>
<p>What it sounds like, will make a new table. Use <code>IF NOT EXISTS</code> to skip if table exists. The structure of the table is defined by its table schema, which is a series of columns in the following parentheses. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">friends</span> <span class="p">(</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>ALTER TABLE</h3>
<p>Choose the table you want to modify with <strong>ALTER TABLE</strong> followed by the table name. <a href="https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-add-column/" target="_blank">Columns can be added by using the <strong>ADD COLUMN</strong> statement</a>, removed by using the <strong>DROP</strong> statement, and renamed with <strong>RENAME TO</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">ALTER</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">dogs</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>DROP TABLE / IF EXISTS</h3>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" target="_blank">(Necessary XKCD)</a>: &quot;Little Bobby Tables&quot;</p>
<p><strong>DROP TABLE</strong> will remove an entire table and all of the data from the database. <strong>IF EXISTS</strong> will make sure no error is thrown if the table doesn't exist.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">DROP</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="k">IF</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span> <span class="n">problems</span><span class="p">;</span>

<h2>Table Data Types</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Data type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>INTEGER, BOOLEAN</td>
<td>The integer datatypes can store whole integer values like the count of a number or an age. In some implementations, the boolean value is just represented as an integer value of just 0 or 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FLOAT, DOUBLE, REAL</td>
<td>The floating point datatypes can store more precise numerical data like measurements or fractional values. Different types can be used depending on the floating point precision required for that value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CHARACTER(num_chars), VARCHAR(num_chars), TEXT</td>
<td>The text based datatypes can store strings and text in all sorts of locales. The distinction between the various types generally amount to underlaying efficiency of the database when working with these columns. Both the CHARACTER and VARCHAR (variable character) types are specified with the max number of characters that they can store (longer values may be truncated), so can be more efficient to store and query with big tables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DATE, DATETIME</td>
<td>SQL can also store date and time stamps to keep track of time series and event data. They can be tricky to work with especially when manipulating data across timezones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BLOB</td>
<td>Finally, SQL can store binary data in blobs right in the database. These values are often opaque to the database, so you usually have to store them with the right metadata to requery them.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><h2>Table Constraints</h2>
<p>Constraints are a special expression in the table's initialization that directs the table to operate in a specific way.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="k">IF</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span> <span class="n">products</span> <span class="p">(</span>

<span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Constraint</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>PRIMARY KEY</td>
<td>This means that the values in this column are unique, and each value can be used to identify a single row in this table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AUTOINCREMENT</td>
<td>For integer values, this means that the value is automatically filled in and incremented with each row insertion. Not supported in all databases.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UNIQUE</td>
<td>This means that the values in this column have to be unique, so you can't insert another row with the same value in this column as another row in the table. Differs from the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> in that it doesn't have to be a key for a row in the table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NOT NULL</td>
<td>This means that the inserted value can not be <code>NULL</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CHECK (expression)</td>
<td>This allows you to run a more complex expression to test whether the values inserted are valid. For example, you can check that values are positive, or greater than a specific size, or start with a certain prefix, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FOREIGN KEY</td>
<td>This is a consistency check which ensures that each value in this column corresponds to another value in a column in another table. For example, if there are two tables, one listing all Employees by ID, and another listing their payroll information, the <code>FOREIGN KEY</code> can ensure that every row in the payroll table corresponds to a valid employee in the master Employee list.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><h2>Queries/Retrieving Data</h2>
<p><strong>SELECT...FROM</strong> statements are queries of <code>column FROM table</code>. <strong>DISTINCT</strong> will remove results that are the same, meaning that they have matching sets of columns in the return. Certain columns could have duplicate values, but ALL of the columns need to match up to another result for it to be considered a duplicate.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">columnName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">anotherColumn</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">tableName</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">DISTINCT</span> <span class="n">columnName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">anotherColumn</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">tableName</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>WHERE</h3>
<p>The <strong>WHERE</strong> clause helps filter out results via a condition. <strong>AND</strong> or <strong>OR</strong> can be used to chain these.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">columnName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">anotherColumn</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">tableName</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">c</span>
  <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="k">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Results of a query can be sorted via the <strong>ORDER BY</strong> keywords, followed by <strong>ASC</strong> or <strong>DESC</strong> (<strong>ASC</strong> is the default).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">columnName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">anotherColumn</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">tableName</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span>
<span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">columnName</span> <span class="k">ASC</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Results can also be tested against whether a column's value is within a list of values.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">columnName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">anotherColumn</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">tableName</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>LIMIT/OFFSET</h3>
<p>Results can be limited via the <strong>LIMIT</strong> and the <strong>OFFSET</strong> keywords. &quot;The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.&quot;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">...</span>
<span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="n">num_limit</span> <span class="k">OFFSET</span> <span class="n">num_offset</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>CONCAT</h3>
<p><strong>CONCAT</strong> allows you to group the values of multiple fields together and call it a new 'field' upon return. <strong>CONCAT</strong> can take multiple arguments and strings to affix together. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">clients</span> <span class="n">c</span>

    <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">userId</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">7070</span>
  <span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>JOIN</h3>
<p>We can join the data within two or more tables with the <strong>JOIN</strong> clause. The two tables can be linked by a certain column with <strong>ON</strong> followed by an expression. (note: <strong>OUTER</strong> is added in as a legacy keyword for SQL-92)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INNER</strong>: Using something that is constant among both tables, usually a key like ascending numbers like IDs or a common string, this will create rows containing both table's data. This will exclude any data that is not found in both tables at that common key.</li>
<li><strong>FULL</strong> (OUTER): This will keep all rows from both tables within the query, even if a matching row does not exist within one of the tables.</li>
<li><strong>LEFT</strong> (OUTER): This keeps anything from the table found after FROM (Left), even if no matching row is found in the table found after JOIN (Right).</li>
<li><strong>RIGHT</strong> (OUTER): This keeps anything from the table found after JOIN (Right), even if no matching row is found in the table found after FROM (Left).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Inclusive/Exclusive</h4>
<p><strong>Inclusive</strong> JOINs will use the <code>ON table1.key = table2.key</code>, matching one column to another. <strong>Exclusive</strong> JOINs follow this with a filter on the focused table set to <code>WHERE table.key IS NULL</code>.</p>
<p>Where <code>n</code> is the two table's intersection, <code>u</code> is the union of the two tables, and <code>-</code> is exclusion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INNER</strong>: AnB</li>
<li><strong>LEFT (Including RIGHT)</strong>: Au(AnB)</li>
<li><strong>LEFT (Excluding RIGHT)</strong>: A-B</li>
<li><strong>RIGHT</strong>: (AnB)uB</li>
<li><strong>RIGHT (Excluding LEFT)</strong>: B-A</li>
<li><strong>FULL/OUTER</strong>: AuBu(AnB)</li>
<li><strong>OUTER (Excluding INNER)</strong>: (A-B)u(B-A)</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">-- This is a venn diagram with both circles fully selected</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>AS</h3>
<p>Expressions, columns, and tables can all be given aliases using the <strong>AS</strong> keyword.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">col_name</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="c1">-- &#39;col_name&#39; has been aliased to &#39;foo&#39;</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>Aggregate Functions</h3>
<p>Aggregate functions run on the entire column. They include operations like <code>COUNT</code>, <code>MIN</code>, <code>MAX</code>, <code>AVG</code>, and <code>SUM</code>, with the desired columns surrounded by parentheses.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">-- returns a single entry with number of entries in col_name</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">COUNT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col_name</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="k">table_name</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">-- returns a single entry with lowest ERA of all pitcher data</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">MIN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">era</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">pitcher_stats</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>These functions can also be run on subsections of these columns using <strong>GROUP BY</strong>, followed by which segments should be calculated together.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">-- returns an entry for the player with lowest ERA on each team</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">player_name</span><span class="p">,</span> 
  <span class="k">MIN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">era</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">pitcher_stats</span>
<span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">team_name</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Further filtering of what should be included in each GROUP can be done with <strong>HAVING</strong>, which operates like WHERE on the GROUP BY element.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">-- returns an entry for the player with lowest ERA above 2 on each team</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">player_name</span><span class="p">,</span> 
  <span class="k">MIN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">era</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">pitcher_stats</span>
<span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">team_name</span>
<span class="k">HAVING</span> <span class="n">era</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/best-way-to-test-if-a-row-exists-in-a-mysql-table" target="_blank">EXISTS - Boolean Check</a></h3>
<p>You can use <strong>SELECT EXISTS (...)</strong> with an enclosed query to return either a 0 (false) or 1 (true) on if any rows were returned.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">-- will return 1 if any rows are found where the name field contains &#39;John&#39;</span>

<h3>Order of Query Execution</h3>
<ol>
<li>FROM and JOIN (loading in data)</li>

<h2>Adding/Changing Rows</h2>
<h3>INSERT INTO / VALUES</h3>
<p>The <strong>INSERT INTO</strong> statement describes which table will have data inserted, and the <strong>VALUES</strong> statement includes all the values of the given row that will go into each column enclosed by parentheses and separated by commas within it. VALUES can correspond to multiple rows by separating the sets of values by commas.</p>
<p>With incomplete data or default values, you can choose which exact columns you want to add data to by following <strong>INSERT INTO table_name</strong> with a set of columns within parentheses and separated by commas. Inserting data this way <em>ensures</em> forward compatibility, as any new columns that are hardcoded into later versions of the table will not be affected.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">mytable</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">column_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">another_column_name</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">VALUES</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value_or_expr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">another_value_or_expr</span><span class="p">),</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value_or_expr_2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">another_value_or_expr_2</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>UPDATE / SET</h3>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> is followed by the name of the table, with <strong>SET</strong> followed by <code>column_name = value_or_expr</code> pairs. These can be used in conjunction with <strong>WHERE</strong> to filter which rows you want updated.</p>
<p>It is recommended to query the items you are going to update before updating them, to ensure you are correctly select what you want.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">-- Update all costs of candy in food I like by raising them 3%</span>
<span class="k">UPDATE</span> <span class="n">food_i_like</span>
<span class="k">SET</span> <span class="n">cost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cost</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">03</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">updated</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">&quot;2021-01-01&quot;</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> 
  <span class="k">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">&quot;candy&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>DELETE FROM</h3>
<p>The <strong>DELETE</strong> statement describes the table to focus on, with <strong>WHERE</strong> describing which rows to delete (<em>leaving out WHERE will delete the entire table!</em>). If you only are trying to get rid of one thing, use <strong>LIMIT 1</strong> to redundantly ensure you <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>It is recommended to query the items you are going to delete before updating them, to ensure you are correctly selecting what you want.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">DELETE</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">food_i_like</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">&quot;Good &amp; Plenty&quot;</span>  <span class="c1">-- always have WHERE to limit deletion</span>
<span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="c1">-- always include this to limit deletion to ONLY one row</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>A SQL variable is defined by calling <strong>DECLARE</strong> followed by the variable name preceded by the <code>@</code> symbol, after which you declare the type. To set the value, use the <strong>SET</strong> keyword followed by the assignment. In MySQL, you only use the <strong>SET</strong> keyword followed by either an equals or a colon-equals.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">DECLARE</span> <span class="nv">@NewVariable</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="kt">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">);</span>

</tbody></table><h2>Expressions</h2>
<p>Many different types of expressions can be used with: <strong>WHERE</strong> to better filter results; and <strong>SELECT</strong> to create new columns of results (column expressions). While there are a few different types of expressions, the examples below are both numeric type expressions. Expressions can also utilize aggregate functions.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">-- Used in WHERE; filters above 0° Celsius</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">Temperature</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="mi">2000</span><span class="n">_Temp_Data</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">Temperature</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">9</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>How to use <a href="sqlite.html">SQLite</a> with <a href="python.html">Python</a>.</p>
<h2>Opening/Closing Connections and Command Execution</h2>
<p>After importing the built-in <code>sqlite3</code> module, you need to establish a connection with your <a href="database.html">database</a>. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sqlite3</span>

<span class="n">conn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;database.db&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># if found at filepath</span>
<span class="n">conn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;:memory:&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>    <span class="c1"># to use RAM (flushed after use)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After creating the connection, create a cursor object and use it to run <a href="sql.html">SQL</a> commands via <code>execute</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;--sql-goes-here&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once all commands have been run, be sure to commit your changes and close the connection.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">commit</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>.fetchone() and .fetchall()</h2>
<p>After you have executed a <code>SELECT</code> command, you can use the cursor as an iterator with <code>fetchone()</code>, which will recall each returned row one by one, or <code>fetchall()</code> to return all rows at once.</p>
<h2>Get table names from database</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">name</span> 
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">sqlite_master</span> 
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="k">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;table&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p><a href="https://cube.fyi/" target="_blank">Cube CSS</a> is a <a href="css.html">CSS</a> framework that is composition first and values it above everything else. The thesis is that when things work together and have a harmony between their design and structure, the amount of work that will need to be done later will be minimal.</p>
<h2>Base CSS</h2>
<p>These are all of your resets ((removing margins, list styles, setting default image width, etc.) and basic choices that will apply to all of your <a href="html.html">HTML</a>. </p>
<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>This is where the bulk of your stylistic choices will be made and they will be made as classes that will be applied.</p>

</article><article><h1>Selectors (CSS)</h1>
<p>Selectors are the backbone of <a href="css.html">CSS</a>, allowing the developer to create stylesheets that apply and cascade to many elements at a time.</p>
<h2>Selectors</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>type</code></li>
<li><code>#id</code></li>
<li><code>.class</code></li>
<li>
<code>[attribute]</code> - Select all elements with attribute<ul>
<li><code>[attribute=&quot;X&quot;]</code> - Select elements with attribute of value 'X' (e.g. <code>attribute=&quot;X&quot;</code>)</li>
<li><code>[attribute~=&quot;X&quot;]</code> - Select elements with an attribute that contains value 'X' (e.g. <code>attribute=&quot;W X Y Z&quot;</code>)</li>
<li><code>[attribute*=&quot;X&quot;]</code> - Select elements with an attribute that contains substring 'X' (e.g. <code>attribute=&quot;WXYZ&quot;</code>)</li>
<li><code>[attribute^=&quot;X&quot;]</code> - Select elements with attribute that starts with 'X' (e.g. <code>attribute=&quot;XYZ ABC&quot;</code> but not <code>&quot;ABC XYZ&quot;</code>)</li>
<li><code>[attribute|=&quot;X&quot;]</code> - Select elements with attribute that has value 'X' or begins with 'X-' (e.g. <code>attribute=&quot;X-YZ&quot;</code>)</li>
<li><code>[attribute$=&quot;X&quot;]</code> - Select elements with attribute that ends with 'X' (e.g. <code>attribute=&quot;VWX&quot;</code>)</li>
<li><code>[... i]</code> - Make selection of the quoted value case insensitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>A B</code> - Select all elements B that are inside of A</li>
<li><code>A + B</code> - Select all elements B that are adjacent to and come <strong>directly</strong> after A</li>
<li><code>A ~ B</code> - Select all elements B that are adjacent to and come after A <strong>at some pont</strong></li>
<li><code>A &gt; B</code> - Select all elements B that are direct children of A</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pseudoclasses</h2>
<p>Pseudoclasses are prefaced by a single colon.</p>
<h3>Parent</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>A:empty</code> - Select element A if they have no child elements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Child</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>A:first-child</code></li>
<li><code>A:last-child</code></li>
<li><code>A:nth-child(n)</code></li>
<li><code>A:nth-last-child(n)</code> - Select every nth element of A counting from the last element to the first</li>
<li><code>A:only-child</code> - Select element A if they are the only child element of their parent element</li>
<li><code>B A:only-child</code> - Select element A if they are the only child element of parent element B</li>
</ul>
<h3>Type</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>A:first-of-type</code> - Select the first element of type A</li>
<li><code>A:nth-of-type(n/even/odd)</code> - Select the nth element of type A or every even or odd numbered instance of element of type A</li>
<li><code>A:nth-of-type(Nn+X)</code> - Select every Nth element of A starting on and including offset X (e.g. A:nth-of-type(2n+3) will select every odd element starting on element 3)</li>
<li><code>A:only-of-type</code> - Select A if it is the only child of that type</li>
<li><code>A:last-of-type</code> - Select the last of element type A</li>
</ul>
<h3>State</h3>
<h4>Links</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>A:link</code> - Select A if it is an anchor element</li>
<li><code>A:visited</code></li>
<li><code>A:hover</code></li>
<li><code>A:active</code> - Select A if it has been selected</li>
</ul>
<p><code>a:hover</code> MUST come after <code>a:link</code> and <code>a:visited</code> in the CSS definition in order to be effective. <code>a:active</code> MUST come after <code>a:hover</code> in the CSS definition in order to be effective. <strong>&quot;LoVe, HAte&quot;</strong></p>
<p>If you want to select an element when hovering over an element:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">parent-selector</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">hover</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">child-selector</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="err">...</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="c">/* Child */</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">parent-selector</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">hover</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">sibling-selector</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="err">...</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="c">/* Sibling */</span>
<span class="c">/* etc. */</span>
</pre></div>
<h4>Forms and Inputs</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>A:focus</code> - Select A if it currently has focus (e.g. text input when selected)</li>
<li><code>A:invalid</code> - Select A if it currently has an invalid entry (e.g. not matching the pattern)</li>
<li><code>A:focus:invalid</code> - Select A if it has focus and has an invalid entry</li>
<li><code>A:placeholder-shown</code> - Select A if the placeholder is being shown</li>
</ul>
<h4>Anchor/URL Hash</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>A:target</code> - Select A if the <code>#id</code> of A is the suffix of the URL.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* &lt;div id=&quot;cool-thing&quot; class=&quot;thing&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; */</span>
<span class="c">/* if URL is index.html#cool-thing, put border around the div with id &quot;cool-thing&quot; */</span>

<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">thing</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">target</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">border</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="kt">px</span> <span class="kc">solid</span> <span class="kc">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Meta</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>A:not(&#x27;X&#x27;)</code> - Select all A elements if they do not match selector or pseudoclass X (e.g. <code>#id</code>, <code>.class</code>, <code>:last-child</code>, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pseudoelements</h2>
<p>Pseudoelements are prefaced by two colons.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A::placeholder</code> - Select the placeholder within element A (e.g. placeholder text of a text input box)</li>
<li><code>A::first-line</code> - Select the first line of a block element.</li>
<li><code>A::first-letter</code> - Select the first letter of an element.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudoclasses allow you to place content before or after the selection. They require a <code>content</code> property and a <code>display</code> property. These pseudoclasses are treated like children of the selected element. e.g. 100% width is 100% width of the selected element.</p>

<p>Transitions allow you to transform a <a href="css.html">CSS</a> rule from one set of values to another, and can be triggered either by a pseudoclass <a href="selectors-(css).html">selector</a>, on a regular cycle, or just once when loaded.</p>
<p>This example I modified from <a href="http://mdn.io" target="_blank">MDN</a> shows how you would transform the background color of a button on hover:</p>

<p>You can include multiple <code>src</code> values via a call to the user's fonts via <code>local(&quot;Font Name&quot;)</code>, <code>url(&quot;...&quot;)</code>, as well as specifying formats after the url (<code>url(&quot;...&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;),</code>), all separated by commas and ending with a semicolon.</p>
<h2><code>@import</code> vs. <code>&lt;link&gt;</code></h2>
<p>To bring in another stylesheet with a font attached, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> and others offer an <code>@import</code> option. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12316501/including-google-web-fonts-link-or-import/12380004#12380004" target="_blank">This unfortunately is blocking</a> and and will delay all other loading until that import is complete.

</article><article><h1><a href="sass.html">Sass</a></h1>
<p>Sass is a <a href="css.html">CSS</a> preprocessor that allows a lot more ease in maintainability and gives much deeper modularity than CSS normally provides. Sass is a language that compiles into CSS, most often used in it's <code>.scss</code> variant, as it is much more similar to normal CSS than its counterpart (<code>.sass</code>).</p>
<h2>Setup/Meta</h2>
<h3>Install Sass</h3>
<p>On <a href="macos.html">Mac</a>, use <code>brew install sass/sass/sass</code> to install the newest version of Sass on your machine.</p>
<h3>Command Line Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>path/to/input.scss:path/to/output.css</code> - Compile the input file to output file</li>
<li><code>path/to/inputfiles/:path/to/outputfiles/</code> - Compile any SCSS files within input directory to output directory as CSS </li>
<li><code>--watch path/to/input.scss:path/to/output.css</code> - Continuously watch the input file and compile it on change to output  file</li>
<li><code>--watch path/to/inputfiles/:path/to/outputfiles/</code> - Continuously watch the input directory and compile any SCSS files within to output directory as CSS on change</li>
<li><code>-v</code> - Output the current version that is being run</li>
<li><code>--sourcemap=none</code> / <code>--no-source-map</code> - Don't output a source map on compile (former for Ruby Sass, latter for Dart Sass</li>
</ul>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Comments are done using the standard Javascript syntax: <code>//</code> and <code>/* */</code> for multiline.</p>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables, like <code>--variable</code> in CSS3, are done by prepending the variable name with a dollar sign</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">$variable-name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When variables are used in a <code>calc</code> function, the variable needs to be surrounded by <code>#{ }</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">width</span><span class="nd">:</span> <span class="nt">calc</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">100</span><span class="err">%</span> <span class="nt">-</span> <span class="nn">#</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="nt">variable</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Nesting</h3>
<p>Instead of writing many specific selectors, you can use nesting to enclose selectors that are children of other selectors. Using an ampersand before a nested selector will write out the selector that is in use at that point in its place when compiled.</p>
<p>Nesting is extremely useful in <a href="bem.html">BEM</a>, as the otherwise long and ugly class names become much more easy to read and navigate. In Sass, the <code>&amp;</code> is shorthand for the entire selector at that point.</p>

<h3>Mixins</h3>
<p>Mixins are a group of declarations or rules that can be reused throughout by copying their contents into a rule. They can also include parameters for dynamic value generation. The <code>mixin</code> is defined by using <code>@mixin</code> and then called with <code>@includes</code> and the name.</p>

<p>Functions are created by using <code>@function</code> with a name and a parameter list. Inside the function, a <code>@return</code> is required. It is common when a raw number is returned to multiply it by <code>1 * unit</code>, with unit being px, em, etc.</p>

<h3>Imports/Partials</h3>
<p>You can create separate stylesheets and import them in to your main sheet.</p>
<p>Partials are what will be <strong>imported</strong> into the main sheet. These filenames start with an underscore and end with <code>.scss</code>.</p>
<p>Depending on the version of Sass that is being used, they use <code>@import</code> or <code>@use</code> followed by the partial enclosed in single quotes <em>without</em> the underscore or the extension. (<code>@import</code> is being phased out, so if you can, use <code>@use</code>)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// partial file is at fp &quot;./base/_base.scss&quot;</span>

<span class="c1">// if using Dart Sass:</span>
<span class="k">@use</span> <span class="s1">&#39;base/base&#39;</span><span class="o">;</span>

<h3>Extending Rules</h3>
<p>Rules can be extended from one element to another one through copying the rules and then further modification (<code>header</code> -&gt; <code>small-header</code>). <code>@extend</code> followed by the original selector. Extend can also be used on a placeholder rule, defined by using a preceding <code>%</code>. </p>
<p><a href="https://csswizardry.com/2014/11/when-to-use-extend-when-to-use-a-mixin/" target="_blank"><strong>Extensions should be used only when the elements it is extending are inherently and thematically related, but extend is generally not advised because you will be &quot;distributing selectors across [your] codebase for purely circumstantial reasons&quot;, leading to bloated and difficult to maintain code.</strong></a></p>
<p>The difference between this and a mixin is instead of bringing <em>code into another rule</em>, we are bringing the <em>selectors that include the extend command to the rule</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/" target="_blank">ITCSS</a> is a way to structure your <a href="css.html">CSS</a> projects to minimize specificty issues and organizational problems. ITCSS is not a naming convention.</p>
<p>ITCSS is most effective when used with a preprocessor like <a href="sass.html">Sass</a>, <a href="less.html">Less</a>, etc.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>The inverted triangle refers to how your <a href="css.html">CSS</a> project should be put together. At the beginning, we have the most far-reaching, least specific, and most generic styles possible. This includes variables, sitewide styles like font-settings, and <a href="css-reset.html">CSS resets</a>. As we go farther in the file, we get more localized, more specific, and more explicit styles. This includes component-specific styles and rules.</p>
<h2>Layers</h2>
<p>The inverted triangle has layers from top to bottom, representing the amount of reach each layer should have; the first layers have the most, decreasing their reach the farther down you go.</p>
<p><strong>The first two layers should not generate any CSS on their own if being used with a preprocessor.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Settings - Variables</li>
<li>Tools - Any mixins or functions that need to be globally available. If they don''t need to be globally available, they should go somewhere else.</li>
<li>Generic - Includes Normalize, <a href="css-reset.html">resets</a>, box-sizing rules, etc.</li>
<li>Elements - These are the styles that refer to unclassed HTML elements. Changing the font-size of headings, the focus styles on inputs, or default anchor and link behavior.</li>
<li>Objects - Undecorated design patterns, like wrappers, containers, rows, grids, etc.</li>
<li>Components - Specific UI components. Most of our styling should go here, as most UI components should be composed of objects and components.</li>
<li>Utilities (Trumps) - Anything that should be able to override the previous styles.</li>
</ol>
<h2>BEMIT</h2>
<p>This framework can be combined with <a href="bem.html">BEM</a> to make the <a href="html.html">HTML</a> more readable for the developer. Using the standard Block, Element (<code>__</code>), Modifier (<code>--</code>) syntax, we can also use prefixes and suffixes to make their functionality more clear.</p>
<h3>Prefixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>o-</code> - Object</li>
<li><code>c-</code> - Component</li>
<li><code>u-</code> - Utility/Trump</li>
<li><code>is-</code>/<code>has-</code> - State</li>
<li><code>js-</code> - Javascript hook</li>
<li><code>_</code> - Outright hacks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Suffixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>@</code> - Responsive media or print queries (need to escape @ in CSS with <code>\@</code>)</li>
</ul>

</article><article><h1><a href="object-oriented-css.html">Object Oriented CSS</a></h1>
<p>Another <a href="css.html">CSS</a> framework</p>
<h2>Main Principles</h2>
<ol>
<li>Separate structure and skin - Structure and position declarations should be in the base object (along with default visual declarations if necessary), while any visual declarations should go into extender classes.</li>
<li>Separate container and content - Break the dependency between the container module and the content objects in contains</li>
</ol>
<h2>More Best Practices</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a component library - Make components (legos) with which you can build your site. These components could include headers, lists, media components, etc. Build these before building your site.</li>
<li>Extend objects by applying multiple classes to an element - Don't make one class do everything. Utilities, modifiers, and base classes can combine to make a much easier to maintain style.</li>
<li>Minimize selectors - Low specificity means less cascade problems and runaway specificity races.</li>
<li>Use consistent semantic styles</li>
<li>Design modules to be transparent on the inside</li>
<li>Be flexible - Height and width should be able to adapt themselves and should not rely on constant babysitting by the designer/developer.</li>
<li>Learn to love grids</li>
</ol>
<h2>9 Pitfalls</h2>
<ol>
<li>Avoid location dependent styles - You want your code to be modular. If it only works if it is in a certain context or position, it is not modular and prone to breakage.</li>
<li>Avoid specifying what tag a class applies - A 'heading' should do something predictable from page to page.</li>
<li>Avoid IDs - They add unnecessary specificity errors and can only be used once, so are needlessly specific.</li>
<li>Avoid drop shadows and rounded corners over irregular backgrounds - This may cause undesired results</li>
<li>Avoid height alignment - Height should be defined by the content of the element. Instead of this, ensure you are separating the container from the content.</li>
<li>Don't use images as text - Screen readers and users on older software often rely on text only and this will make pages needlessly difficult to use.</li>
<li>Avoid redundancy - If two components look too similar to be used on the same page, they are too similar to use on the same site. Choose one!</li>
<li>Avoid premature optimization - If you are unsure what is the best choice, do the naive solution first, and then refactor afterwards.</li>
<li><del>Don't sprite every image together, unless you have very few pages</del> (seems like dated advice at this point)</li>
</ol>
<p>Grids control <strong>width</strong>, content controls <strong>height</strong></p>

<h2>Line Height</h2>
<p>The <code>normal</code> value on a <code>line-height</code> property in <a href="css.html">CSS</a> is calculated as 1.2x the font size; e.g. a font size of 16px will have a <code>normal</code> line height of (1.2 * 16)px = 19.2px.</p>
<p>When setting a defined line-height, use the <code>em</code> unit to set it relative to the current <code>font-size</code>. </p>
<h3><a href="http://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/lineheight.html" target="_blank">Best Practices</a></h3>
<p>1.5em is the most common line height for copy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The longer the line length, the taller the Line-height should be.</li>
<li>The shorter the line length, the shorter the Line-height should be.</li>
<li>Use a taller line-height with continuous copy.</li>
<li>Use taller line-heights with large x-height fonts.</li>
<li>The ascenders and descenders of the lines of text should not touch.</li>
<li>Place the lines close enough together that the reader requires no effort to find the next line, then balance the height based on the line length.</li>

<h2>Block Elements</h2>
<p>To horizontally center a block element with a width other than 100%, use <code>margin: auto;</code>. Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container. The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins.</p>
<h2>Inline and Inline-Block Elements</h2>
<p><strong>Horizontal</strong> alignment can be done using <code>text-align: center;</code>. </p>
<p>To align text <strong>vertically</strong>, however, the <code>vertical-align</code> property is used. The vertical-align property works only with inline and table-cell elements — it won’t work for block, inline-block, or any other element levels. The vertical-align property accepts a handful of different values; the most popular values are <strong>top, middle, and bottom</strong>. These values vertically position text in relation to the table cell, for table-cell elements, or to the closest parent element, for inline-level elements.</p>
<h2>Image/Icon/Font Awesome Alignment</h2>
<p>Although the text needs to be aligned with the image, it is actually the image that needs to be aligned and the text will move accordingly.</p>

<h2>Using 100vh/100vw</h2>
<p>100vh and 100vw won't work as expectedunless you set the margin and padding of the selected element to 0.</p>

</article><article><h1>Position (CSS)</h1>
<p>The <code>position</code> property in <a href="css.html">CSS</a> gives the developer control over the x-, y-, and z-axis in aligning elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>static</code> - This is the default position that a property will have if left unset. The equivalent of being unpositioned. This element will be in the standard flow of the document. This value is the only value that will not create a new stacking context (z-axis).</li>
<li><code>relative</code> - A relatively positioned element will be in the standard flow of the document, but can be positioned <em>relative to</em> its current position (e.g. <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>right</code>). This offset doesn't affect other elements in flow. Space will still exist in flow for this element in it's original position, even if it is moved. <code>relative</code> can create a new stacking context if the <code>z-index</code> is not set to <code>auto</code>.</li>
<li><code>absolute</code> - An absolutely positioned element will be out of the regular flow of the document and can be positioned according to the closest positioned (not static) parent element. No space will be made for it in the document. This can create a new stacking context if the <code>z-index</code> is not set to <code>auto</code>.</li>
<li><code>fixed</code> - Like <code>absolute</code>, a fixed element will be removed from the standard flow and no space will be made. This will be positioned according to the box created by the browser's viewport. This will <strong>always</strong> create a new stacking context and will print on every document when printed.</li>
<li><code>sticky</code> - This is positioned in a normal flow of a document, like <code>relative</code>, and then offset to it's nearest scrolling relative (i.e. has an <code>overflow</code> property set to a scrolling value). This will also always create a new stacking context.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Colorblindness Colors</h2>
<p><a href="https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/#pallet" target="_blank">https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/#pallet</a></p>
<p>From their page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a proposal of color pallet that is
1: unambiguous both to colorblinds and non-colorblinds,
2: with vivid colors so that color names are easy to identify,
3: can be printable with similar color both on screen and when printed. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For red, vermilion is used since it is recognizable also to protanopes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colors between yellow and green are all avoided, since they are indistinguishable with yellow and orange. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For green, bluish green is chosen so that it won't be confused with red or brown. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since violet is close to blue and appear the same to colorblinds, reddish purple is chosen. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between vermilion and yellow, three colors with different apparent intensity is selected. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sky blue and blue are chosen so that they are distinguishable with there difference in brightness and saturation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even for non-coloblinds, thin lines and small characters in blue and yellow are hard read. For thin lines and small objects, use darker blue and orange is preferable to sky blue and yellow. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When combining colors from this pallet, </p>
<ul>
<li>Use &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; colors alternatively. </li>
<li>When using two warm colors or two cool colors, put distinct differences in brightness or saturation. </li>
<li>Avoid combination of colors with low saturation or low brightness. </li>
</ul>

<p>Miscellaneous notes and best practices on organization and structure in <a href="css.html">CSS</a>.</p>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<h3>Keep it consistent</h3>
<p>If you get to set the rules for the project or are working alone, then the most important thing to do is to keep things consistent. Consistency can be applied in all sorts of ways, such as using the same naming conventions for classes, choosing one method of describing color, or maintaining consistent formatting (for example will you use tabs or spaces to indent your code? If spaces, how many spaces?)</p>
<p>If you are working with a team on an existing project, the first thing to check is whether the project has an existing style guide for CSS. <strong>The team style guide should always win over your own personal preferences</strong>. There often isn't a right or wrong way to do things, but consistency is important.</p>
<h3>Organize Code with Comments</h3>
<p>Adding comments to your CSS will help any future developer work with your CSS file, but will also help you when you come back to the project after a break. A good tip is to <strong>add a block of comments between logical sections in your stylesheet</strong> too, to help locate different sections quickly when scanning through, or even give you something to search for to jump right into that part of the CSS. <strong>If you use a string which won't appear in the code you can jump from section to section</strong> by searching for it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* || General Styles */</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="c">/* || Utilities */</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Build Proficient Selectors</h3>
<p>Don't use IDs in your <a href="selectors-(css).html">selectors</a>. This messes with the specificity and often breaks cascades. In general, in seems like it's best practice to stick with classes as your selectors.</p>
<p>Keep selectors short, since the longer they get, the more apt they are to break. If you create very specific selectors you will often find that you need to duplicate chunks of your <a href="css.html">CSS</a> to apply the same rules to another element. Try to reduce nesting to two or three levels deep and remove as many location-based selectors as possible. Usually, these longer selectors are overkill and unnecessary. If you do find that you need to use a really specific selector, refactor it into a new manageable class.</p>
<h3>Use Shorthand Properties &amp; Values</h3>
<p>Do this to increase readability. If your shorthand <code>font:</code> property is not more readable, then it is not better. Shorthand properties can also introduce undesired resetting of properties (sometimes unrelated) back to their initial value.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* bulky, but clear */</span>
<span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Drop Units from Zero Values</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* BAD */</span>
<span class="nt">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">0px</span> <span class="nt">10px</span> <span class="nt">0px</span> <span class="nt">0px</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="c">/* GOOD */</span>
<span class="nt">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">0</span> <span class="nt">10px</span> <span class="nt">0</span> <span class="nt">0</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Use The Right Measurement For The Right Job</h3>
<p>I have read many different pieces of advice on this. Use <code>rem</code> for everything, use <code>em</code> for everything, don't use <code>px</code> ever, use <code>60ch</code> as the width of a page, etc. I do believe that using <code>rem</code> for everything may cause blowout of a page when zooming in a lot for accessibility, due to enormous borders, margin, etc. This is some advice I found online that seems to make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>px</code> for border widths, box shadows, etc. (decoration)</li>
<li><code>rem</code> or <code>em</code> for font sizes (<code>rem</code> for modular component-based layouts)</li>
<li><code>vw</code>/<code>vh</code>/<code>%</code> for layout and display specific rules, since they change with the browser size</li>
<li><code>rem</code> for font sizes and for margins and padding</li>
<li><code>ch</code> for things like paragraph text widths or sizing containers that will hold monospace fonts (50-70 chars wide is a common human-readable width, so aim for <code>60ch</code> in this case)</li>
<li><code>em</code> for media queries (e.g. <code>max-width: 40em</code> is equal to 640px with a font-size of 16px, but will scale if user has it set differently)</li>
<li><code>in</code>/<code>cm</code>/<code>mm</code> for print queries</li>
</ul>
<h3>Group &amp; Align <a href="vendor-prefixes-(css).html">Vendor Prefixes</a></h3>
<p>Keep them together and add whitespace to make the values aligned. </p>
<p>When using vendor prefixes we need to make sure to place an unprefixed version of our property and value last, after any prefixed versions, to ensure the most desired setting loads last if possible.</p>

<h3>Modularize Styles for Reuse</h3>
<p>Refactor names to fit their purpose and reduce hacky &quot;fixes&quot; to shoehorn stuff in to other class rules. Keep your code <a href="don't-repeat-yourself.html">DRY</a>!</p>
<h3>Break large stylesheets into multiple smaller ones</h3>
<p>In particular in cases where you have very different styles for distinct parts of the site, you might want to have a stylesheet that includes all the global rules and then smaller ones that include the specific rules needed for those sections. You can link to multiple stylesheets from one page, and the normal rules of the cascade apply, with rules in stylesheets linked later coming after rules in stylesheets linked earlier.</p>
<h2>Structure / Formatting</h2>
<h3>Create logical sections in your stylesheet</h3>
<p>Using the ideas from 7-1 <a href="sass.html">Sass</a> architecture, we can create an organization that will allow us to organize our styles in a way that allows for a logical hierarchical cascade and easy management. The 7 sections are abstracts, vendors, base, layout, components, pages, and themes.</p>
<h4>Media Queries</h4>
<p>Note: media queries don't have an exact space so far as I have found, but there are a couple approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>for maintenance and modularity's sake, keeping them with the rest of the relevant rules feels logical.</li>
<li>for the cascade, putting them at the end of their respective file before the utilities allows them to take priority over rules with similar specificity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Abstracts</h4>
<p>Abstracts are code that does not output <a href="css.html">CSS</a> (variables, and in <a href="sass.html">Sass</a>, functions and mixins).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* || VARIABLES */</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h4>Vendors</h4>
<p>This includes any third party stylesheets, like Bootstrap, or font imports like Google Fonts.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* || VENDORS */</span>

<span class="p">@</span><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;700&amp;display=swap&#39;</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<h4>Base</h4>
<p>Basic definitions like animations, default styles, typography, resets/normalizers and utilities like classes for center text, margin bottom, etc. It is a good idea to have all of the common styling early in the stylesheet so that all of these styles will generally apply unless you do something special with that element.</p>

</pre></div>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>This could have styles for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebar, etc.), the grid system, or even <a href="css.html">CSS</a> styles for all the forms. These are the &quot;macro&quot; components.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* || LAYOUT */</span>

<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">grid</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="err">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h4>Components</h4>
<p>Modules that will be reused often throughout the project (buttons, forms, media boxes, etc.). These are the &quot;micro&quot; components in comparison to the layout.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* || COMPONENTS */</span>

<span class="c">/* | BUTTON */</span>

<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">button</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="err">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">button--white</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="err">...</span>

  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">button--magenta</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="err">...</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h4>Page</h4>
<p>These are styles specific only to the specific page you are on. Many times a home page will have different layouts than the blog or the about page. This is where you would put the styles for that specific page.</p>
<p>For a single stylesheet, this will likely be just another section as opposed to another file.</p>
<h4>Theme</h4>
<p>For large projects, this allows a plug-and-play way to change the theme of your site. Usually this is not used on smaller applications.</p>

</article><article><h1><a href="assembly.html">Assembly</a></h1>
<p>Assembly is an extremely low-level human-readable language that has a strong relation between the code and the corresponding <a href="machine-code.html">machine code</a>.</p>
<h2>Compilation and Linking</h2>
<p>For more specifics, visit the <a href="assembly-(unix).html">OSX</a> and <a href="assembly-(windows).html">Windows</a> assembly pages. </p>
<p>You will first need a program to compile your assembly into machine code. Most common is the program <a href="https://nasm.us/" target="_blank">nasm</a> for <a href="unix.html">Unix</a> systems and <a href="https://www.masm32.com" target="_blank">masm</a> for <a href="windows.html">Windows</a> systems.</p>
<p>After you have written your code, you will need to assemble your code, translating it from the human readable assembly language into a file object.</p>
<p>You will then need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_%28computing%29" target="_blank">link</a> your newly created output file. This will pull all the needed libraries into a single executable. </p>

</tbody></table><h2>Flags</h2>
<h3>Carry Flag (<code>CF</code>)</h3>
<p>The carry flag is set to 1 (true) when the second operand of an operation is smaller than the first. For example if you <code>cmp 2 1</code>, the result will be a <code>CF</code> of 1 (true), since 1 - 2 goes negative, meaning that the first operand is larger than the first.</p>
<h3>Overflow Flag (<code>OF</code>)</h3>
<p>The overflow flag will be set to 1 (true) if the operation overflows beyond the bounds of the integers and their storage. This could happen if you are dealing with numbers that go beyond the boundaries involved (e.g. adding two numbers that go above 256 with an 8-bit unsigned integer, or adding two 8-bit unsigned integers that go beyond 128).</p>
<h3>Sign Flag (<code>SF</code>)</h3>
<p>The sign flag will be set to 1 (true) after an arithmetic operation when the result is negative.  </p>
<h3>Zero Flag (<code>ZF</code>)</h3>
<p>The zero flag is set after an arithmetic operation and will have a value of 1 (true) when the result is zero, and 0 (false) when the result is not zero.</p>
<h2>Stack</h2>
<p>The <a href="stack-(programming).html">stack</a> is used to invoke a function or as temporary storage by pushing parameters in last in first out to be utilized by the function.</p>
<p>This will push the number 3 onto the stack and then write it to the EAX register.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>push 3
pop eax
ret
</pre></div>
<p>This will push three values to the stack <strong>in reverse order of what the function expects, because LIFO</strong>, and then invokes the function, which will use those values.</p>

<h3>Linking Your File</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_%28computing%29" target="_blank">Linking</a> your newly created output file will pull all the needed libraries into a single executable. The following command will run Link, the masmlinker, and finish the creation of your executable.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="se">\m</span>asm32<span class="se">\b</span>in<span class="se">\L</span>ink /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE hello_world.obj

<h3>Assembling Your Code</h3>
<p>Assembling your code will translate it from the human readable assembly language into a file object. The following bash command will run <code>nasm</code> using the Mach-O 64bit object <code>-f</code>ile notation format used by the 64-bit version of <a href="macos.html">MacOS</a> and create <code>-o</code>utput <code>hello_world.o</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nasm -f macho64 hello_world.asm -o hello_world.o
</pre></div>
<h3>Linking Your File</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_%28computing%29" target="_blank">Linking</a> your newly created output file will pull all the needed libraries into a single executable. The following <a href="bash.html">bash</a> command will run <code>ld</code>, the GNU linker, and finish the creation of your executable.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ld -macosx_version_min <span class="m">10</span>.7.0 hello_world.o -o hello_world
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>-macosx_version_min</code> flag is added to remove the warning that is present without it. I read that it still builds fine without it, but that has not been true in my experience.</p>
<h3>Executing Your File</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ./hello_world
Hello, World
</pre></div>
<p>Running <code>./hello_world</code> in <a href="bash.html">bash</a> should result in the message being displayed.</p>

<section><h2>Backlinks:</h2><ul><li><a href="assembly-(unix).html">Assembly (Unix)</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h1><a href="canvas.html">Canvas</a></h1>
<p>The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via <a href="javascript.html">JavaScript</a> and the <a href="html.html">HTML</a> <canvas> element.</p>
<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>To start using the canvas, put the canvas element in your webpage HTML, along with a width or height in pixels. Fallback content goes in between the opening and closing tag.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">canvas</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;canvas-name&quot;</span> <span class="na">width</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;150&quot;</span> <span class="na">height</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;150&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">canvas</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The canvas is initially blank and then needs to be accessed, with the new context assigned to a variable. This variable will become the way to draw on the canvas.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">canvas</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;canvas-name&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">ctx</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">canvas</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getContext</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;2d&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Drawing</h2>
<p>Canvas only supports rectangles and paths.</p>
<h3>Rectangles</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">fillRect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">height</span><span class="p">)</span>   <span class="c1">// Draws a filled rectangle.</span>
<span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">strokeRect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">height</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// Draws a rectangular outline.</span>
<span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">clearRect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">height</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">// Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Paths</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#paths" target="_blank">From MDN</a>:</p>
<p>A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. To make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you create the path with <code>beginPath()</code></li>
<li>Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path</li>
<li>Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it with <code>closePath()</code></li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">beginPath</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">// Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.</span>
<span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">closePath</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">// Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.</span>
<span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">stroke</span><span class="p">()</span>    <span class="c1">// Draws the shape by stroking its outline.</span>
<span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">fill</span><span class="p">()</span>      <span class="c1">// Draws a solid shape by filling the path&#39;s content area.</span>
</pre></div>
<h4>Path Methods</h4>
<p><code>moveTo(x,y)</code> <strong>moves the pen without recording it as a path</strong> to be drawn or filled.</p>
<p><code>lineTo(x,y)</code> should be used to draw <strong>straight lines</strong>.</p>
<p><code>arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, anticlockwise)</code> will draw an <strong>arc centered at x, y</strong>.</p>
<p><code>arcTo()</code> is often used to make rounded corners <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/arcTo" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/arcTo</a></p>
<p><code>quadraticCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, x, y)</code> and <code>bezierCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y, x, y)</code> are also good for [rounded shapes](<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#paths" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#paths</a>. </p>

</article><article><h1>Web Fonts (HTML)</h1>
<p>To import a font from Google Fonts, you can copy the font(s) URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your <a href="html.html">HTML</a>. For this challenge, we'll import the Lobster font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening style element):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster&quot;</span> <span class="na">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/css&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now you can use the Lobster font in your <a href="css.html">CSS</a> by using Lobster as the <code>FAMILY_NAME</code> as in the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">FAMILY_NAME</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">GENERIC_NAME</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>GENERIC_NAME</code> is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available.</p>

</ol>
</article><article><h1>Anchor Tags (HTML)</h1>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>Using the <code>download</code> attribute will instruct the browser to download the file enclosed in the value of the download attr. The value is optional.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;file.pdf&quot;</span> <span class="na">download</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Download Here<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;file.pdf&quot;</span> <span class="na">download</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;new-filename.pdf&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Download Here<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So far I have not seen the attribute force a download of a file, but I have seen it change the download name of the file re: things like PDFs.</p>

</article><article><h1><a href="semantic-html.html">Semantic HTML</a></h1>
<p><a href="html.html">HTML</a> without any styling or functionality should be readable and the user should easily be able to discern context about the content.</p>
<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Headings should be used for semantics only, <strong>not</strong> for font sizing (<a href="html.html">HTML</a> for structure, <a href="css.html">CSS</a> for styling).</p>
<p>Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document automatically. </p>
<p>Use only one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> per page or view. It should concisely describe the overall purpose of the content. Using more than one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> will not result in an error, but is not considered a best practice. Using only one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is beneficial for <a href="accessibility.html">screenreader users</a>, and SEO. Avoid skipping heading levels: always start from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, followed by <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and so on.</p>

<p>More complex tables with empty cells/row headers have added accessibility needs, like <strong>scope=&quot;col/row&quot;</strong> depending on what the header organizing.</p>
<h2>Merging Cells</h2>
<p>The colspan attribute is used to <strong>span a single cell across multiple columns</strong> within a table, while the rowspan attribute is used to <strong>span a single cell across multiple rows</strong>. Each attribute accepts an integer value that indicates the number of cells to span across, with 1 being the default value.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">tr</span> <span class="na">rowspan</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;2&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
   <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">td</span> <span class="na">colspan</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;3&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>...<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">td</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">tr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>This can't be done using <a href="css.html">CSS</a>. It must be done using inline styles.</strong> </p>
<h2>Borders</h2>
<p>The <strong>border-collapse</strong> property determines a table’s border model. There are three values for the border-collapse property: <strong>collapse, separate, and inherit</strong>. By default, the border-collapse property value is separate, meaning that all of the different borders will stack up next to one another, as described above. The collapse value, on the other hand, condenses the borders into one, choosing the table cell as the primary border.</p>
<p>The <strong>border-spacing</strong> property may accept two length values: the first value for horizontal spacing and the second value for vertical spacing.</p>

<h2>devDependencies</h2>
<p>You can save packages as a devDependency by using <code>--save-dev</code> as an option in the CLI.</p>
<p><code>devDependencies</code> are for the <strong>developers</strong> of the project. Things like test frameworks, documentation, etc. If someone downloads and uses your project, they won't have the dev dependencies installed. If someone wants to build on your project, they can download the dev dependencies.</p>

<p>Sublime Text is an application made for software development.</p>
<h2>Command Line Shortcut</h2>
<p>To create a symlink in <a href="bash.html">bash</a> that will allow you to open any folder in Sublime Text:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;export PATH=&quot;/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin:$PATH&quot;&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;export PATH=&quot;/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin:$PATH&quot;&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile
</pre></div>
<p>Now you can just type <code>subl .</code> in a given folder, a la <code>code .</code> in <a href="visual-studio-code.html">Visual Studio Code</a></p>
<h2>Troubleshooting Errors</h2>
<h3>Autocompletion/Snippets</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the console (<code>View &gt; Show Console</code> or <code>ctrl + `</code> on <a href="macos.html">OSX</a>).</li>
<li>In the console, enter in <code>sublime.log_commands(True)</code>.</li>
<li>Do what you need to recreate the issue. Immediately after triggering the unwanted behavior, document what you think is causing it that is in the console. In my case it was <code>command: insert_snippet {&quot;contents&quot;: &quot;:$0;&quot;}</code>.</li>
<li>Depending on which syntax you are in, or which plugin is listed/suspected, use the command palette to <code>View Package File</code> and type in the syntax/plugin. This will show files that are hidden, as well, which makes diagnosing issues with default plugins/syntaxes much  easier. In my case this was in the <code>keymap</code> file.</li>
<li>Once you find a possible file, open it. <code>Save As</code> in the <code>Packages</code> directory under a new folder called the name of the plugin or syntax. e.g. for the <a href="sass.html">Sass</a> plugin/syntax, I created a folder in <code>Packages</code> called <code>Sass</code> and saved a copy of the <code>Default.sublime-keymap</code> file there, which included my additions. <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/packages.html" target="_blank">You can find more on overriding packages here</a>.</li>
<li>In my case, I copied the old rule over and changed the <code>{&quot;contents&quot;: &quot;:$0;&quot;}</code> object to <code>{&quot;contents&quot;: &quot;:$0&quot;}</code>, which allowed the colon to be typed without adding any additional characters.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>
<p>Packages in Sublime Text are interdependent on each other and many of the default packages are inferior to third-party (e.g. <a href="babel.html">Babel</a> over <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a>). When nested syntaxes are not cooperating, in this example <a href="pug.html">Pug</a>'s Javascript syntax, you can <code>Disable Package &gt; Javascript</code> and install <code>Babel</code> and this will cause Pug to correctly highlight conditionals and the succeeding code.</p>

<p>Pug is a templating engine for <a href="html.html">HTML</a> that allows you to write a simpler more condense webpage, as well as integrating <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> to dynamically generate pages.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Install it using <a href="npm.html">NPM</a>: <code>npm i -g pug-cli</code>. You can compile a Pug file directly, or by watching the file and it's dependencies for changes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># compile the single file</span>
pug filename.pug -o ./outputfolder
<span class="c1"># watch the file and its dependencies for changes and compile on change</span>
pug -w filename.pug -o ./outputfolder
</pre></div>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>Writing <a href="html.html">HTML</a> in Pug is very similar to <a href="emmet.html">Emmet</a> shorthand/selectors in <a href="css.html">CSS</a>.</p>
<p><code>element#id.class(attr=&quot;value&quot; foo=&quot;bar&quot;) innerText</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>header#header.header.header__wrapper
  .header__logo
    span
      img.header__logo-img(src=&quot;...&quot; alt=&quot;Logo&quot;)
      |  Some text!
  h1 Company Name

//- outputs

//- <span class="nt">&lt;header</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;header&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;header header__wrapper&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
//-   <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;header__logo&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
//-     <span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;...&quot;</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">&quot;Logo&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span> Some text!<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
//-   <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
//-   <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Company Name<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
//- <span class="nt">&lt;/header&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>// This comment will appear in the HTML

//- This is a silent comment

//-
  Nesting inside a comment creates
  a comment block
</pre></div>
<h3><a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a></h3>
<p>Any line that starts with a hyphen or anything that follows an equals sign in an attribute list can be valid Javascript.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>- var num = 6;
- var name = &quot;John Smith&quot;;

h1(data-name= name.replace(/\s/, &#39;.&#39;).toLowerCase() )= `This guy is probably <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="cp">}</span> feet tall!`

//- outputs
//- <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">data-name=</span><span class="s">&quot;john.smith&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>This guy is probably 6 feet tall!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Inline</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>h1: span.header Yeah!

//- Outputs

</pre></div>
<h3>Multiline</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>p.
  This text can be broken 
  up on multiple lines
  
//- outputs

script.
  console.log(&#39;or here&#39;);
  // This works too.
</pre></div>
<h3>Self-Closing Tags</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>hr 
//- outputs &lt;hr/&gt;

foo/
//- outputs &lt;foo/&gt;
</pre></div>
<h3>Imports / Include</h3>
<p>Pug allows import of HTML directly as well as Pug files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">include</span> <span class="nv">filename</span>.<span class="nv">pug</span>
<span class="k">include</span> <span class="nv">another</span>.<span class="nv">html</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables in Pug are defined as they are in Javascript and should be preceded by a hyphen. Multiline variable definitions are done by starting a line with a hyphen, <strong>leaving no whitespace</strong>, and continuing indented on the next line. As long as the indentation remains, you will be in &quot;Javascript land&quot;.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>- var location = &#39;russia&#39;;
-
  var obj = {
    thing: &quot;one&quot;,
    otherThing: &quot;two&quot;,
  }

p= location
span(class= obj.thing) OK

//- outputs 

//- <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>russia<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>Conditionals</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>- var location = &#39;russia&#39;;

each item in items
  p.item(id= item.replace(&#39; &#39;, &#39;-&#39;))= item.toUpperCase()
  
//- outputs

<h2>Sublime Text Syntax</h2>
<p>Packages in <a href="sublime-text.html">Sublime Text</a> are interdependent on each other and many of the default packages are inferior to third-party (e.g. Babel over Javascript).

<p>The basics of <a href="html.html">HTML</a> forms, <a href="semantic-html.html">semantic HTML</a> forms, and validation.</p>
<h2>Form Element</h2>
<p>The <code>action</code> attribute that defines the action to be done upon submission as an address or href. The <code>method</code> is the <a href="http-methods.html">HTTP method</a> to use in completing the action.</p>
<h2>Input Types</h2>
<h3>Input</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Pre-HTML5 input types:<ul>
<li><code>button</code></li>
<li><code>checkbox</code></li>
<li><code>file</code></li>
<li><code>hidden</code></li>
<li><code>image</code></li>
<li><code>password</code></li>
<li><code>radio</code></li>
<li><code>reset</code></li>
<li><code>submit</code></li>
<li><code>text</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
HTML5 input types:<ul>
<li><code>color</code></li>
<li><code>date</code></li>
<li><code>datetime</code></li>
<li><code>email</code></li>
<li><code>month</code></li>
<li><code>number</code></li>
<li><code>range</code></li>
<li><code>search</code></li>
<li><code>tel</code></li>
<li><code>time</code></li>
<li><code>url</code></li>
<li><code>week</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These values were added to <strong>provide clearer semantic meaning</strong> for inputs as well as to provide better controls for users. Should a browser not understand one of these HTML5 type attribute values, it will automatically <strong>fall back to the</strong> <strong>text</strong> <strong>attribute</strong> value.</p>
<h3>Label</h3>
<p>The <code>label</code> element provides a label for an input element, with its <code>for=&quot;&quot;</code> attribute referencing the <code>id</code> attribute of the element it is to label.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;thing&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">label</span> <span class="na">for</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;thing&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Thing!<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Select</h3>
<p>The <code>size</code> attribute chooses how many choices are visible at a time. The boolean attribute <code>multiple</code>, when added to the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element for a standard drop-down list, allows a user to choose more than one option from the list at a time. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">label</span> <span class="na">for</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;things&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Things!<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">select</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;things&quot;</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;things&quot;</span> <span class="na">multiple</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">option</span> <span class="na">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;thing1&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Thing 1<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">option</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">option</span> <span class="na">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;thing2&quot;</span> <span class="na">selected</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Thing 2<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">option</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">select</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Textarea</h3>
<p>A <code>textarea</code> has <code>rows</code> and <code>columns</code> attributes to determine the size, but can be done more efficiently with CSS styling.</p>
<h3>Button</h3>
<p>Always include <code>type=&quot;button&quot;</code> for compatability across browsers.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">button</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;button&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Click Here<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">button</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Radio Buttons and Checkboxes</h3>
<p>A radio button and checkbox <code>input</code> element can be checked by default by adding the <code>checked</code> boolean attribute to the <code>input</code> field. This requires them being within a <code>form</code> element; otherwise they will not select correctly in all browsers.</p>
<h3>Fieldsets and Legends</h3>
<p><strong>Fieldsets group form controls and labels into organized sections</strong>. Much like a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or other structural element, the <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> is a block-level element that wraps related elements, specifically within a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element, for better organization. The <strong><code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> element wraps text describing the form controls that fall within the fieldset</strong>. The markup should include the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> element directly after the opening <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">form</span> <span class="na">action</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">fieldset</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">legend</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Thing Description:<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">legend</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">label</span> <span class="na">for</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;things&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Things!<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">select</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;things&quot;</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;things&quot;</span> <span class="na">multiple</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">option</span> <span class="na">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;thing1&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Thing 1<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">option</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">option</span> <span class="na">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;thing2&quot;</span> <span class="na">selected</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Thing 2<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">option</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">select</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">fieldset</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">form</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Field Validation</h2>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Use the correct input type (text, email, password, etc.)</p>
<p>The <code>pattern</code> attribute is used to specify a <strong><a href="regular-expressions.html">regular expression</a></strong> and the field value must match this pattern. This attribute can be used with input types like text, password, email, url, tel and search. Validation occurs upon submission.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">&lt;!-- Should match if five numbers from 1 to 4 appear in a row --&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">pattern</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;[1-4]{5}&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>A <code>required</code> attribute indicates that a value must be specified for the input element.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">required</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>maxlength</code> is an integer value that specifies the maximum number of characters allowed for a particular input field.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">maxlength</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;20&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>min</code> &amp; <code>max</code> attributes specify the lower and upper limit respectively for an input element.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;number&quot;</span> <span class="na">min</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="na">max</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;5&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<section><h2>Backlinks:</h2><ul><li><a href="react-from-scratch.html">React from Scratch</a></li><li><a href="text-compression-(server).html">Text Compression (Server)</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h1>Text Compression (Server)</h1>
<p>Text compression minifies and zips files on build or on client side rendering of your web page. Using this on your deployed webpage can save significant time in page downloads and lead to better user retention.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>To accomplish client-side rendering, you will need to implement the compression on the building of your pages (in this case, using <a href="webpack.html">Webpack</a>) as well as on your server (<a href="express.html">Express</a>). This example is for a <a href="react.html">React</a> project using <a href="webpack.html">Webpack</a> and <a href="express.html">Express</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="webpack.html">Webpack</a></h3>
<p>First, install <a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/compression-webpack-plugin" target="_blank"><code>compression-webpack-plugin</code></a> and add it to your <code>webpack.config.js</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">module.expor</span><span class="kc">ts</span> <span class="err">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="err">...</span>
  <span class="err">plugi</span><span class="kc">ns</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="kc">ne</span><span class="err">w</span> <span class="err">Compressio</span><span class="kc">n</span><span class="err">Plugi</span><span class="kc">n</span><span class="err">(</span><span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="err">algori</span><span class="kc">t</span><span class="err">hm</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">&#39;gzip&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="kc">test</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">/\.(js|css)$/i</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">}</span><span class="err">)</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="err">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="err">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This will use <a href="http://www.gzip.org/" target="_blank">GZIP</a> to compress all <a href="javascript.html">JS</a> and <a href="css.html">CSS</a> files in your project.</p>
<h3><a href="express.html">Express</a></h3>
<p>Similar to Express's <code>app.use(express.static(...))</code>, this will allow Express to serve the GZIP files to the user. You need to install <a href="https://github.com/tkoenig89/express-static-gzip" target="_blank"><code>express-static-gzip</code></a> and then add this to your server JS file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">express</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;express&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">expressStaticGzip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;express-static-gzip&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">expressStaticGzip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/my/rootFolder/&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>On Your Server</h3>
<p>On your server, add/merge your new code, <code>npm i</code> all the new dependencies, restart any PM2 instances and NGINX, and away you go!</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code/Codium is an <a href="open-source.html">open-source</a> application developed by Microsoft for software and code development.</p>
<h2>Extensions Missing</h2>
<p>If an extension is found on VS Code but not on VS Codium, it can still be installed by sideloading it as a VSIX.  &quot;You'll have to sideload that extension since the marketplace that VS Codium uses is OpenVSX which hosts only open source extensions&quot;[1]. </p>
<p>You can download it on the website and in the &quot;Extensions&quot; pane of VS Codium, click the dots up top and choose &quot;Install VSIX&quot;.</p>

<section><h2>Backlinks:</h2><ul><li><a href="fetch-api.html">Fetch API</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h1><a href="fetch-api.html">Fetch API</a></h1>
<p>Fetch API is a part of vanilla <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> that does <a href="http-requests.html">HTTP requests</a>. </p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The syntax for <code>fetch</code> is <code>fetch(&#x27;URL&#x27;)</code>. <code>fetch()</code> ALWAYS returns <a href="promises.html">promises</a>. These promises will be fulfilled when the data is finished loading, and can be accessed with <code>.then(function (response) { ... })</code>. Within <code>.then</code>, you can resolve this promise with <code>.json()</code>, <code>.text()</code>, or <code>.blob()</code>, which all return their <em>own</em> promise. Errors are handled through a <code>.catch(function (response) { ... })</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;http://web.site&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// response is a Promise, so it will be resolved within this function</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">json</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// response.json is *also* a Promise</span>
  <span class="p">}).</span><span class="nx">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">json</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// do thing with JSON response</span>
  <span class="p">}).</span><span class="k">catch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>With async/await</h3>
<p>If you encapsulate the fetch call within a function, you can declare that function as an <code>async</code> function and make the calls inside the function <code>await</code>. Because it's an <code>async</code> function, it will also return a promise, which can be handled by <code>.then</code> and <code>.catch</code>.</p>

<h4>useState</h4>
<p>With <code>useState</code> in <a href="react.html">React</a> hooks, you will need to use a special syntax in creation of the hooks themselves. Since useState is a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html" target="_blank">generic function</a>, the typing happens within the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> characters.</p>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p>In <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a>, all of these operators on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy" target="_blank">truthy</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy" target="_blank">falsy</a> values, meaning that all values will be converted to boolean before comparison.</p>
<h3>Used with Non-Boolean Types</h3>
<p>When using non-boolean values, the return value will not be a boolean, but one of the values compared. </p>

</article><article><h1>Classes (Javascript)</h1>
<p>Classes in <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> generally are created with two different sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>prototypes</code> or <code>methods</code> will be how all the instances of the class should be <strong>similar</strong> (things like <code>addYear</code> for a person class). This is commonly done in the <code>prototype</code> object.</li>
<li>The constructor will define how the instances are <strong>different</strong> (the <code>name</code> property of a person class). This is commonly done through the invocation of the constructor, like <code>function (name) { this.name = name }</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Class Types</h2>
<h3>Decorators</h3>
<p>A decorator is a function that accepts an object and <strong>adds more properties or functionality</strong> to it. It's common to use <strong>adjectives</strong> as the names of these decorators. Decorators allow for more DRY code and help keep all elements together that should be, allowing little ambiguity in execution.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// this decorator makes obj more &#39;carlike&#39;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">carlike</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">loc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>Functional Classes</h3>
<p>A functional class is a construct that is <strong>capable of making a fleet of objects</strong> that conform to the same interface. They are commonly capitalized in name. The functions that produce these functional classes are called <strong>constructors</strong>. The object that is returned is called an <strong>instance</strong> of that class. </p>
<p>The difference between a decorator and a functional class is that a decorator accepts their target object as input, whereas the class builds and returns the object it's augmenting.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Car</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">loc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>Functional Classes with Shared Methods</h3>
<p>Using shared methods allows you to save space in memory, as only one instance of a method needs to exist, as opposed to one for every single instance.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Car</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">loc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="c1">// using UnderscoreJS (see polyfill)</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">carMethods</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</pre></div>
<p><code>_.extend</code> polyfill:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">extend</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">destination</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">source</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">destination</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Prototypal Classes</h3>
<p>Using <code>Object.create()</code>, we can create an object that inherits all properties of the enclosed object into its <code>prototype</code>. This will mean that on a failed lookup, it will search within this object for a reference, inheriting the old objects as they were at the time of inheritance.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Car</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">loc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">Car</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">prototype</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">move</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">loc</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">newCar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Car</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Pseudoclassical Classes</h3>
<p>The pseudoclassical class is a <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> syntactic sugar that allows a more conventional style of object oriented programming to be implemented.</p>
<p>By running a function with the <code>new</code> keyword before it, the interpreter runs the program in a special &quot;construction&quot; mode. Since you will always want to be creating an object and returning it when you are finished, the <code>new</code> keyword adds these two lines at the beginning and end, respectively, to your function. The object created will be automatically bound to <code>this</code> and will use the <code>prototype</code> property found inside that function.</p>
<p>The two different parts of a pseudoclassical class are doing two distinct roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>the constructor is defining what is different about each instance. In this example, what <code>loc</code> is.</li>
<li>the methods are defining what is similar about each instance. In this example, what <code>move</code> does.</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Car</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">loc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">loc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">loc</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>ES6 Classes (<code>class</code>)</h3>
<p>The ES6 implementation is extremely similar to the pseudoclassical implementation, but uses more syntactic sugar to make it more readable and more similar to other object-oriented languages.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nx">Car</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">constructor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">loc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">loc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">loc</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  
  <span class="nx">move</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">loc</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">newCar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Car</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
<p>Polymorphism is the design of objects to be able to share behaviors and override certain shared behaviors to work more specifically on the new object. There is a super class and a sub class. The sub class inherits the properties and methods from the super class. In the following examples, the super is <code>Shape</code> and the sub is <code>Square</code> or <code>Triangle</code>. </p>

<h2>Property Lookup/Prototype Chains</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a given property of an object, the interpreter will first look at the object itself, and if it fails on that lookup, will look at any other objects that are associated via prototype chain.</p>
<p>To have an ongoing prototype chain, where one object will always default on a failed lookup to searching within another object, you can use <code>var newObj = Object.create(oldObj)</code>. <code>newObj</code> will now default to looking up any failed lookups in <code>oldObj</code>. The values will be calculated during the lookup time, as the values are not stored or copied into the new object. The new object has a link to the old object and will perform on a lookup on the old object in its current state.</p>

</article><article><h1><a href="higher-order-functions.html">Higher Order Functions</a></h1>
<p>A higher-order function either takes in a function as an argument, or returns a function.</p>
<h2>Callback Functions</h2>
<p>When taking a function as a parameter, this is called a <strong>callback function</strong>. This is used in Javascript built-ins like <code>setTimeout</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>forEach</code>.</p>

<h2>Closures</h2>
<p>Functions that return other functions can create <strong>closures</strong>, which means that the variables within which the function is defined will remain accessable by that function; the variables are <strong>enclosed</strong> within that function's own scope.</p>
<p>In the example below, a function called <code>counter</code> keeps track of how many times it is called. Even though the function runs and fully completes, the reference to this execution context remains with the function that is returned at the conclusion of that invocation. We cannot <em>directly</em> access <code>count</code> from outside of the scope of <code>counter</code>, but with the returned function, we can add to it and see what <code>count</code>'s value' is at that point.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>While the syntax of apply and call are almost identical, the fundamental difference is that <strong>apply</strong> accepts an <strong>array</strong> of arguments, and <strong>call</strong> accepts a <strong>comma</strong>-separated argument list.</p>
<h2>Bind</h2>
<p>The <code>bind()</code> method <strong>returns a new function</strong> that, when called, has its <code>this</code> keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>X = document.createTextNode(&#x27;text&#x27;)</code></li>
<li><code>X = document.createElement(&#x27;li&#x27;)</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Alteration</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>X.className = &#x27;class&#x27;</code></li>
<li><code>X.id = &#x27;id&#x27;</code></li>
<li><code>X.setAttribute(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;value&#x27;)</code></li>
<li><code>X.innerHTML = &#x27;&lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>X.insertAdjacentHTML(position, Y)</code> will insert <a href="html.html">HTML</a> string Y at position of element X. <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/11/insertadjacenthtml-enables-faster-html-snippet-injection/" target="_blank">(This method is much better than an <code>innerHTML +=</code>)</a> The positions are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">&lt;!-- beforebegin --&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- afterbegin --&gt;</span>
  foo
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- beforeend --&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- afterend --&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>X.textContent = &#x27;text&#x27;</code></li>
<li><code>X.innerText = &#x27;text&#x27;</code></li>
<li><code>X.childNodes[n].nodeValue = &#x27;...&#x27;</code> will allow you to change the inner text of an element, even when it includes another element (e.g. changing <code>some more text</code> in <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;yeah&lt;/em&gt;some more text&lt;/span&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insertion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>X.appendChild(Y)</code> will append element Y as the last child of element X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>X.prepend(Y)</code> will prepend element Y as the first child of element X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>X.parentNode.insertBefore(Y, X);</code> will insert element Y directly before element X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>X.parentNode.insertBefore(Y, X.nextSibling);</code> will insert element Y directly after element X</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Duplication</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>X.cloneNode(true)</code> will return a copy of the selected element.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Search</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>X.querySelector(Y)</code> will find the first element based on CSS element search Y within the tree of elements found at X.</li>
<li><code>X.querySelector(Y)</code> will find all elements based on CSS element search Y within the tree of elements found at X.</li>
<li><code>X.closest(Y)</code> will find an element based on CSS element search Y from element X up through all of the parents to the top of the DOM</li>
</ul>
<h2>DOMParser</h2>
<p>The <code>DOMParser</code> allows you to parse <a href="html.html">HTML</a> in as a string, returning an <code>HTMLDocument</code> object. This allows you to interact with the DOM elements and alter them much more simply and easily than using regex or find/replace in a text-editor.</p>
<p>The DOMParser operates very similarly to <a href="jquery.html">jQuery</a>'s ability to parse HTML in as a string within <code>$(&#x27;&lt;input&gt;&#x27;)</code>. The difference is that DOMParser returns an HTMLDocument instead of a <a href="jquery.html">jQuery</a> object.</p>
<h3>Importing Plain Text</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">parser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">DOMParser</span><span class="p">();</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>Exporting Plain Text</h3>
<p>You can return each of the top level elements (<code>head</code>, <code>body</code>) as plain text using <code>innerHTML</code>.  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">htmlDoc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">innerHTML</span><span class="p">;</span>

</article><article><h1>Lexical Scoping (Javascript)</h1>
<p><strong>Lexical Scoping</strong> defines how variable names are resolved in nested functions: inner functions contain the scope of parent functions even if the parent function has returned.</p>
<p>With <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a>, a new scope is created <strong>only</strong> through function definitions. Every time a new function scope is created, it will contain the scope of the parent functions, along with its own. This does not go both ways, however: the outer scope does not have access to those in the inner scope.</p>

<h2><code>this</code></h2>
<p><strong><code>this</code>, within a function, is bound to the object within which the function is being called</strong>. Look to the left of the calltime dot to find the binding of <code>this</code>. The Javascript interpreter binds <code>this</code> to a <strong>likely-focal object</strong>, which means it isn't always what you think it is. Assume its binding will run into trouble, so you may need to at times manually set <code>this</code> to the desired object.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have defined your function in the global scope, then <code>this</code> is implicitly bound to the global context, which in a browser is <code>window</code>. You can call this function <code>funcName</code> also by calling <code>window.funcName</code></li>
<li>If you have defined your function as part of an object, like <code>var obj = { funcName: function (a) { ... } }</code>, then <code>this</code> is bound to <code>obj</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All variables in <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> are <code>undefined</code> by default after declaration.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Var, Let, and Const</h2>
<p>Use <code>const</code> over <code>let</code> and <code>let</code> over <code>var</code> unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value may change</li>
<li>The var needs to be initialized</li>
<li>It is used in an iterator or a loop</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="lexical-scoping.html">Block scoped</a></strong> means within a block or indentation level (starting with <code>{</code> and ending with <code>}</code>) or outside of a function. This means that one can use <code>let</code> outside of a function and declare a new variable with <code>let</code> again within a function.</p>
<h3>const</h3>
<p><code>const</code> is block scoped. Short for &quot;constant&quot;, meaning that it is a variable that once defined, cannot be redefined, changed through reassignment, redeclared, or updated. This also means one can cannot initialize a variable through <code>const</code> without a value. <code>const</code> can only be accessed within the scope they were created.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">greeting</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello there!&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">// This can never be changed, as it is a constant.</span>
<span class="nx">greeting</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hi.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// This throws an error</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Reference types created with <code>const</code> can have their <em>attributes</em> updated, but cannot be updated itself.</p>

<h3>let</h3>
<p><code>let</code> is also block scoped; <code>let</code> variables can be updated, but not redeclared.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">greeting</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello there!&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>
<h3>var</h3>
<p><code>var</code> variables are function scoped and not a constant. Even when defined within a function, they can affect the global scope. These variables can also be redeclared and updated at any point.</p>
<p>As of ES2015, <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> are fully supported in modern browsers, so <code>var</code> is not advised.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">greeting</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello there!&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">//These are all acceptable</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Define Multiple Variables At Once</p>
<p>One can use commas to const many different variables at once.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">yes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;yes&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>

      <span class="nx">hi</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hi&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Global Declaration</h3>
<p>Global variable declarations are made by using no keyword before the definition:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">greeting</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hi.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<h2>Hoisting</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The JS code interpretation performed in two passes. During the first pass, the interpreter processes variable and function declarations. The second pass is the actual code execution step. The interpreter processes function expressions and undeclared variables.[7]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Hoisting Variables</h3>
<p>The term &quot;hoisting&quot; is meant to represent a literal hoisting of variable and function declarations to the top of a Javascript file, where they will be declared before the file is interpreted (while this is not technically what happens, it's certainly more memorable).</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39; &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this example, because interpreters normally run from top to bottom, executing each line as they go, one would expect an error thrown at the <code>console.log</code> because it would not be aware of any variable named <code>d</code>. Because of hoisting, however, <code>d</code> is <em>declared</em> by the interpreter but not <em>initialized with a value</em>, so it actually logs <code>undefined</code> instead.</p>
<p>Another weird case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39; &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Since the declaration of <code>d</code> (<code>var d;</code>) is &quot;hoisted&quot; above the assignment (<code>d = 3;</code>), this actually does not throw any errors and logs <code>3</code>.</p>
<h3>Hoisting Functions</h3>
<p>The hoisting of functions is similar to variable hoisting, in that the declaration of any named functions will be &quot;hoisted&quot;. However, what makes functions different in this is that <strong>their definition will be hoisted as well as their declaration</strong>.</p>
<p>In general, you do not want to hoist any functions within the browser unless you have a good reason, since it costs a lot of extra memory for the browser. This can be avoided by using anonymous functions as opposed to named functions like below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Outputs: &quot;Definition hoisted!&quot;</span>
<span class="nx">definitionHoisted</span><span class="p">();</span>

</article><article><h1>Event Listeners (Javascript)</h1>
<p>Event listeners in <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> run a function on the emitting of an event, including <code>click</code>, <code>keyup</code>, <code>resize</code>, and more.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;eventType&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// do something</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This adds a listener to whatever element it is attached to. It waits for the 'event' to occur, and once it does, it calls the callback function. The <code>e</code> (short for <code>event</code>)is the callback object, which can give you information on the event and its related elements.</p>
<p>One can also pass in a named function instead of use an anonymous one. This can lead to cleaner code, as it is more declarative than imperative</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;event&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">onClick</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">onClick</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="c1">// do something</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There is a third Boolean parameter of addEventListener that specifies if you want the handler to fire on capture or bubble. It defaults to false, which is bubble. But if you set it to true, it will fire on capture.</p>
<h2>The Event Object</h2>
<p>The <code>e</code> that is in the functions pertaining to <code>eventListener</code>'s in <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> is the object that is returned by a specific event with many parameters like the coordinates of the click, the element clicked, etc. If you have an <code>eventListener</code> attached to a certain element that will trigger on a <code>click</code>, then when the user clicks, it will return an event object. This event object is what gets passed as <code>e</code> into the function.</p>
<p><code>e.target</code> is used to specify the element on which you clicked.</p>
<h2>Event Bubbling and Delegation</h2>
<p>Event bubbling is where an event listener attached to a certain element will be triggered by a child element. This is because of the elements being nested within each other. If <code>div2</code> is nested within <code>div1</code>, a trigger on <code>div2</code>, will also trigger <code>div1</code>, since <code>div2</code> is nested within <code>div1</code>.</p>
<p>Event delegation is a pattern where an event listener attached to an element is not triggered unless a specified child element is the trigger. This is useful if there are many elements that have the same class name or ID and you want an action done to a specific one. It is done through if statements on the callback specifying attributes like class name or id.</p>

<p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous <a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a> And <a href="xml.html">XML</a>. It is an asynchronous way to get and send data. Usually used with <a href="json.html">JSON</a>. AJAX is built in to Javascript.</p>
<p>When an AJAX call is made in your Javascript code, the AJAX engine takes your request and converts it into a proper XmlHttpRequest. The website that is being queried then responds (with JSON or XML) and the AJAX engine then converts it into an <a href="html.html">HTML</a> response that can be parsed by Javascript.</p>
<p>Ajax is able to asynchronously handle <a href="http.html">HTTP</a> requests and responses, interpreting the requests from JS to HTTP and responses from JSON to HTML responses. This allows a fluid application that doesn't need to refresh the browser to function.</p>
<p>A standard implementation of AJAX involves these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating the XHR object</li>
<li>Defining the request parameters</li>
<li>Instructions on a successful and unsuccessful request</li>
<li>Sending/starting the request</li>
</ol>
<h2>XMLHttpRequest (XHR Object)</h2>
<p><strong>XMLHttpRequest</strong> is an API that is in the form of an object, with methods and properties attached. When a request is made and when a response is received, all of that work goes on behind the scenes and this object is updated as things happen.</p>
<p>To use the XHR object, a new instance needs to be created and assigned to a variable.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">xhr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">XMLHttpRequest</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>.open()</h3>
<p><code>.open()</code> is an XHR function that takes three parameters: type of request, URL or file name, and a boolean of whether it is asynchronous or not.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;GET&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://www.requestURL.com&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>.onreadystatechange</h3>
<p>You define a function at that property, and it will run every time the <code>readyState</code> property of the XHR object changes. The readyState values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - Request not initialized</li>
<li>1 - server connection established</li>
<li>2 - request received</li>
<li>3 - processing request</li>
<li>4 - request finished and response is ready</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onreadystatechange</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// if the readyState property of the XHR object (&#39;xhr&#39;) is 4</span>
  <span class="c1">// AND the status in the XHR object is &#39;OK&#39;</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>.onprogress</h3>
<p><code>.onprogress</code> is a property that holds a function, defined by the developer, that will be called once the <code>readyState</code> is at 3, when the request is being processed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onprogres</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Show the loading image or something that denotes waiting  </span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>.onload / .onerror</h3>
<p><code>.onload</code> and <code>.onerror</code> are properties that hold functions, defined by the developer, that will be called once the <code>readyState</code> is at 4, when the request is finished and response is ready, or when an error is detected.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onload</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onerror</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Request error&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>.setRequestHeader()</h3>
<p>When making a <code>POST</code> request, you will need to set the request header. This function takes two parameters: the name of the header and the value it will have. This can be called multiple times in a row to set multiple parameters, and they will all be compiled together to one header. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" target="_blank">Learn more about HTTP headers here</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setRequestHeader</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Content-type&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;application/json&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>.send()</h3>
<p>This will send the request that has already been created by <code>.open()</code>. The body of the request should be passed in as a parameter, but it is optional, like in a simple GET request.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">send</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Response Data Types</h2>
<p>All of the previous examples have been for if you are making a request for a <strong>plaintext</strong> file, by getting the <code>responseText</code> property from the XHR object. If your response ends up being a <strong><a href="json.html">JSON</a></strong> file, you can parse this with <code>JSON.parse(this.responseText)</code>.</p>

</article><article><h1><a href="react-from-scratch.html">React from Scratch</a></h1>
<p>Learn how <a href="react.html">React</a> works by building it without the <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank">create-react-app</a> framework.</p>
<p>For React to work properly, you will need three things: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="babel.html">Babel</a> - This is a transpiler that will allow you to use JSX within your components and make your site usable to clients that do not have ES6 functionality available.</li>
<li><a href="webpack.html">Webpack</a> - This is a compiler that will take all of your modules, styles, etc. and put them together.</li>
<li><a href="react.html">React</a> - This is the meat and potatoes that will render your page, let you use state, hooks, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to do this is with <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank">create-react-app</a>. But if you want to know how it works:</p>
<h2>Get all your parts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initialize a new <a href="npm.html">npm</a> project with <code>npm init</code>. You can skip all the questions with the <code>-y</code> flag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <code>babel</code> in your development dependencies:
<code>npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react</code>. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>@babel/core —</em> This contains the babel core configuration, </li>
<li><em>@babel/preset-env —</em> This contains different plugins, the most important of which transforms all  ES2015-ES2020 code to be ES5 compatible (the one JavaScript version where almost all browsers implement)</li>
<li><em>@babel/preset-react —</em> This contains different plugins to enable React syntax parsing and transformation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <code>babel-loader</code> for webpack to use:
<code>npm install --save-dev babel-loader</code></p>
<ul>
<li>To transform our code, we will use a package called <code>babel-loader</code>. <code>babel-loader</code> will allow us to transpile our JavaScript file using babel and webpack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <code>webpack</code> in your development dependencies:
<code>npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server</code></p>
<ul>
<li><em>webpack —</em> the core webpack functionality package. </li>
<li><em>webpack-cli —</em> this package is necessary to use the CLI.</li>
<li><em>webpack-dev-server —</em> this is for the dev server that allows live reloading</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <code>react</code> in your project.
<code>npm install react react-dom</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the <code>public</code>-facing folder for the client, and an <code>app.js</code> within a sibling <code>src</code> folder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Make your webpack config and babel config</h2>
<p>In the root folder, create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file that pulls in the node <code>path</code> module. This is where you will be putting your entry and output points in your webpack builders. (TA: Search 'webpack configuration' and you should be reminded of all the things you need.)</p>

<p>MongoDB is a <a href="nosql.html">NoSQL</a> <a href="database.html">database</a> management system using documents similar to <a href="json.html">JSON</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>This will start a new project using your local server and mongoose via <a href="node.html">node</a>.</p>
<h3>Local Machine</h3>
<p>Install MongoDB using <code>brew services install mongodb-community</code>. Once installed, you can start your local server using <code>brew services start mongodb-community</code> (Be sure to stop the server when completed with your work using <code>brew services stop mongodb-community</code>).</p>
<p>In the terminal, start the mongo shell: <code>mongo</code>.</p>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p>Create a new database: </p>
<h3>Node</h3>
<p>Create a new folder and initialize a new node project using <a href="npm.html">npm</a>: <code>npm init -y</code>. Then install <code>npm i mongoose</code>.</p>
<p>Create a new file called <code>server.js</code> and copy this into the contents:</p>

</article><article><h1>C (Programming)</h1>
<p>C is a programming language that is very low-level, compiling down to <a href="assembly.html">assembly</a> language.</p>
<h2>Hello, World</h2>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>Create a new file called <code>helloworld.c</code> and add this to the contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="c1">  /* Imports the standard library for IO */</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>  <span class="cm">/* defines the function main containing no parameters */</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;hello, world</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="cm">/* prints &quot;hello, world&quot; in stdio */</span>
    <span class="cm">/* note that the newline must be placed deliberately. C does */</span>
    <span class="cm">/* not add a newline with print like Python does. */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Compile</h3>
<p>Then you want to compile it. The basic compiler found on UNIX computers is <code>cc</code>. Compile it by typing <code>cc helloworld.c</code>. This will create a file called <code>a.out</code>, which is the compiled version of your <code>helloworld.c</code>. </p>
<h3>Run It</h3>
<p>Run this by typing <code>./a.out</code> in your shell. You should see <code>hello, world</code> in your terminal.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Single line comment</span>
<span class="cm">/* Multiline</span>
<span class="cm">   comment */</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<p><code>main</code> is a special function that will begin executing when running your compiled file. This must be named <code>main</code>, but other functions can take on whatever other names you'd like.</p>
<h3>Symbolic Constants</h3>
<p>Symbolic constants allow the developer to avoid <a href="magic-numbers-(programming).html">magic numbers</a> and add semantically useful labels to values. This is done using he syntax <code>#define NAME value</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>
<span class="cp">#define TAXRATE 0.09</span>
<span class="cp">#define SERVICECHARGE 2</span>

<span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;The tax rate is %1.2f and the service charge is %d&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">TAXRATE</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">SERVICECHARGE</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="cm">/* prints &quot;The tax rate is 0.09 and the service charge is 2&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>These statements don't actually <em>do</em> anything in the code. They are handled by the preprocessor and the references to the <code>NAME</code> are simply replaced by the corrseponding <code>value</code> when found. So the above <code>printf</code> line, when eventually seen by the compiler, will be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;The tax rate is %1.2f and the service charge is %d&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.09</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Types</h3>
<p>Since C is strongly typed, certain actions that are intuitive in Javascript or Python may not yield the results you wanted. For instance, if you have variable <code>int x</code> and you try and initialize it with a fractional number, the fractional part will be discarded since <code>x</code> stores an <code>int</code>.</p>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the beginning before executing your program. They are declared by type and then by name.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">num</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">step</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">letter</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<h3>stdio.h</h3>
<h4>printf(string, [format, ...])</h4>
<p>If you use a format tag in the string, like <code>%d</code> or <code>%c</code>, you will need to add what will replace it in the list of <code>format</code> variables.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">fahr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">celsius</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">fahr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">celsius</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">37</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%d F = %d C&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fahr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">celsius</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="cm">/* prints &quot;100 F = 37 C&quot; */</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The format tags can also be accompanied by the minimum width of characters printed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%3d F = %3d C&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fahr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">celsius</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="cm">/* prints &quot;100 F = 37  C&quot; */</span>
<span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%2d F = %2d C&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fahr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">celsius</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="cm">/* prints &quot;100 F = 37 C&quot; */</span>
</pre></div>
<h4>getchar(), putchar(x)</h4>
<p><code>getchar</code> will resolve to a character from stdin, and <code>putchar(x)</code> will put the value of <code>x</code> in stdout.</p>

<p>Postgres is a relational <a href="database.html">database</a> management system.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>This tutorial will be for getting started with Postgres using <a href="node.html">node</a> on a <a href="macos.html">Mac</a>.</p>
<h3>Local Machine</h3>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>Install Postgres using <a href="homebrew.html">homebrew</a>: <code>brew install postgres</code></p>
<p>In a new terminal window, start up the local database: <code>postgres -U username -d database_name</code>, filling in the blanks as needed. If this does not work, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17633422/psql-fatal-database-user-does-not-exist" target="_blank">ensure you have the local database installed at your username</a>. The DB can be also started using <code>brew services start postgres</code> (Be sure to stop the server when completed with your work using <code>brew services stop postgres</code>).</p>
<p>To enter into interactive mode, in your terminal, enter <code>psql</code>. From here, you can enter in any queries you'd like. Ensure they all end with a semicolon, or else you will not get any return back and it will throw.</p>
<h4>Initialization</h4>
<p>Create a new table in your database: <code>CREATE TABLE numbers( age integer );</code></p>
<p>Insert a value into the new table: <code>INSERT INTO numbers VALUES (732);</code></p>
<h3>Javascript</h3>
<p>Initialize a new <a href="npm.html">npm</a> project, and then install <code>pg</code>, <code>pg-format</code>, and <a href="express.html"><code>express</code></a>.</p>
<p>Create a new file in your project called <code>server.js</code> and copy this into it's contents:</p>

<p>Now in your terminal, run <code>node server.js</code> and assuming the database is still running, if should return:</p>

<h2>Schemas</h2>
<p>Schemas are within a database but are ways of organizing tables, objects, functions, etc. within the database. In a database with table1, table2, and table3, a schema could hold table1 and table2, with another schema holding table2 and table3.</p>
<p>To create a schema, use  <code>CREATE SCHEMA name</code>, followed by the other components.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">SCHEMA</span> <span class="n">schema_example</span>
  <span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">people</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">id</span> <span class="nb">INT</span> <span class="k">PRIMARY</span> <span class="k">KEY</span><span class="p">,</span>
