Thai is a tonal language and the native language of Thailand.

## Basics

Note that all of this should be a reference! As Thai is tonal, you should be listening to Thai to fully grok it. Check the references below for good Youtube videos to help you.

### Kráp/Kâ

The words *kráp/khráp* and *kâ/khâ* are multi-use words in Thai, where *kráp* is used by men and *kâ* for women. *Kráp* can also sound like *krup* or *kup*.

They can be used as ways to soften a phrase or question for politeness (think situations like speaking with store owners, waiters, reception at a hotel, elders, etc.), placed at the end of the statement. 

> Informal: "Sawat-dee" (Hello/Goodbye)

> Formal: "Sawat-dee kráp" (Hello/Goodbye)

They can also be used as a word of acknowledgement or agreement, using it almost as an English "uh huh", "okay", or "yes".
