Seemingly contradictory to the ideas of Orwell in his essay [Politics and the English Language](http://www.public-library.uk/ebooks/72/30.pdf):

> (i) Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
> (ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> (iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> (iv) Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> (v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English
> equivalent.
> (vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.
