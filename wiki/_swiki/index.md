Welcome! Here, we are fans of having a tiny brain, which means, not keeping everything in your head all of the time. 

Click on some things and [email](mailto:milopfultz@gmail.com) me if you want. If you see something wrong or want to improve this site, feel free to [submit edits as a PR](https://github.com/milofultz/tinybrainfans/). If you saw things here that are now gone, it probably got absolved into another page or moved over to [my website](https://milofultz.com/).
