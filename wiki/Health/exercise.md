Exercise is bodily activity that is usually used to maintain wellness and is generally good for you.

Good advice from antranik[3]:

## Bodyweight Exercise/Calisthenics Routine

From Reddit's bodyweightfitness[2]:

> Complete 2-6 circuits of the following exercises, completing one set of each exercise comprises one circuit. Take little to no rest.
