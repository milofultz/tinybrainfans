## Theme Years

Notes on CGP Grey's "Your Theme" video[1]:

* Setting intentions towards what kind of person you want to be is more effective than setting goals, especially if you are the kind of person to be discouraged by "failing".
* Themes should be broad, directional, and resonant. Broad so that you aren't stuck in a pass/fail paradigm, directional that you know what choice to make when confronted with one, and resonant so that you earnestly want to pursue it in an almost hedonistic, visceral sense.
* The word should mean something to *you*. It does *not* need to mean anything to anyone else. Only *your* definition matters.
* These broad ideas or "goals" are good because they will get you to the crossroads to make decisions you want. Like meditation prepares you to consider choices once you center yourself, this gives you a large area to aim for.
* It doesn't have to be a year. Years are just nice because of new years resolutions. Set a timeline that is good for you to be able to check in again at some point.
* The potential problem with a year is that [12-week year](https://12weekyear.com/) problem. You have motivation for the first month and a half or so, and then usually right at the end. So a quarter kind of wraps that all together.
