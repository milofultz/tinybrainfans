Visual Studio Code/Codium is an {{open-source}} application developed by Microsoft for software and code development.

## Extensions Missing

If an extension is found on VS Code but not on VS Codium, it can still be installed by sideloading it as a VSIX.  "You'll have to sideload that extension since the marketplace that VS Codium uses is OpenVSX which hosts only open source extensions"[1]. 

You can download it on the website and in the "Extensions" pane of VS Codium, click the dots up top and choose "Install VSIX".
