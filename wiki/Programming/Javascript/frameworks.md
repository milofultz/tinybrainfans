{{Javascript}} frameworks are abundant and everywhere, so I wanted to collate a list with some blurbs and first impressions.

## Frameworks

{{Alpine.js|Alpine}}: A really minimal framework that also allows functionality to be added to the HTML markup. Surprisingly full featured, has side-effect handling and a global store, too.

Backbone[4]: A jQuery solution that is more of a way to model and organize the data you are going to be passing around. Uses templating from [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/) to build components. [A tutorial is here](https://adrianmejia.com/backbone-dot-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started/).

htmx[6]: Super lightweight and lets you bake in your actions directly to the HTML. If your app is simple enough, means no JS is needed at all. Wild stuff.

Marko[3]: Can write your functionality into the HTML similar to Vue.

{{React}}: The classic. Makes SPA's slick and clean using components, but requires quite a few dependencies and {{Webpack}} and {{Babel}}, so is a bit unwieldy.

{{Vue}}: Allows functionality to be written in your HTML components, along with accompanying CSS and JS for each component.
