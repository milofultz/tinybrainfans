Enforce rules and raise warnings to keep your {{Javascript}}, {{Typescript}}, and {{React}} code clean and bug free.

## Ignore rule in a file

By placing this at the top of the file, it will ignore this rule throughout the entire file. `/* eslint-disable {rule} */`

To disable a rule for only one line, place this after the code on the offending line. `// eslint-disable-line {rule}`
