## devDependencies

You can save packages as a devDependency by using `--save-dev` as an option in the CLI.

`devDependencies` are for the **developers** of the project. Things like test frameworks, documentation, etc. If someone downloads and uses your project, they won't have the dev dependencies installed. If someone wants to build on your project, they can download the dev dependencies.
