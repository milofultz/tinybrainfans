## Download

Using the `download` attribute will instruct the browser to download the file enclosed in the value of the download attr. The value is optional.

```html
<a href="file.pdf" download>Download Here</a>
<a href="file.pdf" download="new-filename.pdf">Download Here</a>
```

So far I have not seen the attribute force a download of a file, but I have seen it change the download name of the file re: things like PDFs.
