## Contrast

There needs to be a contrast of at LEAST 4.5:1 between the background and foreground of colors for readability. 

> In WCAG 2, contrast is a measure of the difference in perceived "luminance" or brightness between two colors (the phrase "color contrast" is never used). This brightness difference is expressed as a ratio ranging from 1:1 (e.g. white on white) to 21:1 (e.g., black on a white).
