Rails is a web application framework written in {{Ruby}}. In comparison to something like {{Node}}'s {{Express}}, it is a *much* higher level instance of an application framework.

From the Ruby on Rails page[1]:

> The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:
>
> * Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.
> * Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.

What this means is that there is quite a bit of abstraction done right out of the gate to handle the things that are most commonly implemented in websites. If you are coming from a {{Javascript}}-oriented background, this amount of abstraction and meta-programming might feel very overwhelming, but the more time you spend learning about it, you'll see that it can be used very effectively for specific types of sites.

> If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.[1]
