## The Seven Ur-languages[2]

From [madhadron](https://madhadron.com/posts/seven_languages.html):

> [N]ot all languages have the same set of patterns. The patterns for looping in C or Python are very different from the patterns of recursion in Standard ML or Prolog. The way you organize a program in Lisp, where you name new language constructs, is very different from how you organize it in APL, where fragments of symbol sequences are both the definitions of behavior and become the label for that behavior in your  mind.
>
> These distinct collections of fundamentals form various *ur*-languages. Learning a new language that traces to the same *ur*-language is an easy shift. Learning one that traces to an unfamiliar *ur*-language requires significant time and effort and new neural pathways.
