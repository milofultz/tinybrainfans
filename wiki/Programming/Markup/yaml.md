title: YAML
description: YAML is a markup language that is great for non-technical users, but has many flaws.

While YAML is nice and convenient for small configuration files, it has many flaws[2], most notably the Norway problem[3] and all it's siblings. Utilizing another language that can be parsed into data is most likely a better idea for whatever usage you have in mind. For example:

* {{TOML}}
* {{XML}}
* {{JSON}}
* {{KDL}}
