[Cube CSS][] is a {{CSS}} framework that is composition first and values it above everything else. The thesis is that when things work together and have a harmony between their design and structure, the amount of work that will need to be done later will be minimal.

## Base CSS

These are all of your resets ((removing margins, list styles, setting default image width, etc.) and basic choices that will apply to all of your {{HTML}}. 

## Composition

This is where the bulk of your stylistic choices will be made and they will be made as classes that will be applied.

## Utilities

## Block

## Exception
