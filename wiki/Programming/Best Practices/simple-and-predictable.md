title: Simple and Predictable
description: Software should be simple and predictable.

> To make a product feel simple, every time a person takes a particular action, they should see the same result. That predictability means the user always understands their place in a product.
>
> Thereâ€™s an added bonus here: **not only is predictability key to simplicity, predictability is also a substitute for control.**[1]

A tool should strive for

- orthogonality - single entry and exit point with no side effects
- predictability - the user can intuit what will happen when it is used
- simplicity - the user can hold the majority of use cases in their head, referring to a manual for the edge cases if necessary
