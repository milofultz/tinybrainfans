## Convert Webpages To Ebooks

You can convert downloaded webpages to ebooks in Calibre by downloading the page, putting the HTML and its contents in a zip file, adding it to Calibre, and then converting it to whatever format you like. This can also be done with many different types of in/out combinations[2] in the command line[3], if you want to make a script for this.
