## Sticky/Unresponsive Road Shifters

If you are experiencing difficulty with your road shifters, it is likely that the grease inside of the mechanism has accumulated dust and no longer catches the shifting thingy. It may be good to mount the bike or place it upside down (much harder) so you can shift easily.

Squeeze the brakes until you see the inside of the shifting mechanism. Spray a liquid penetrant like Pb Blaster or Kroil inside of the mechanism and try shifting up and down repeatedly for a couple minutes. You should notice an improvement, but it probably won't be fixed. Wait and repeat in a couple of hours.

Once finished, get some compressed air and flush out any gunk in there, and some isopropyl alcohol if you want to be super thorough.

## Derailleur Adjustment/Indexing

You will want the bike mounted or flipped upside down so you can pedal the bike for shifting gears.

### Set the limit screws

On each derailleur, there is a high or "H" and a low or "L" screw. These maintain the limits of how far your derailleurs will go towards or away from the frame. 

Shift to the lowest gear and adjust the "L" screw to where the derailleur is perfectly aligned with the gear. You will see it move side to side. If you don't, you're probably turning the wrong way. If it's not moving enough, you may need to adjust the cable length.

Repeat this process with the highest gear and the "H" screw.

### Set the gear indexing

This will calibrate the gear shifting to not skip or go halfway on shift.

Start at the lowest gear. While "pedaling", shift to the next gear. This is when you are testing the fluidity of the shifting, so stop once the shifting is not occurring as expected.

If the shifting is not occurring as you'd like, you will want to adjust the barrel connectors until the derailleur is directly above the desired gear. On the front derailleur, it will be on the downtube; on the rear, it will be attached to the derailleur. As you adjust, you should see the derailleur move side to side. 

Once the index is accurate, continue on to the next gears until complete.
