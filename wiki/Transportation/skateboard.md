Longboarding is one of my favorite things: gets you somewhere and it's {{exercise}}.

## Tricks[9-15]

Honestly, not much more I can say except to check out the links from [9-15]. Too much in there and the videos are gold anyway.

## Portable Boards

If you are like me and want to travel with a longboard but don't want to even test the tempers of the TSA, here are some longboards that fit the general carry on requirements:

### Eggboard[1]: 19"

I got this and can attest to its size and ability. Was skeptical at first if it could turn, *also* turn without serious wheelbite, and not just let you eat shit going over a small bump. But it rides like a dream: wide trucks, soft wheels, long wheelbase for size. Pretty much rides like a slightly shorter Landyachtz Dinghy.

### Magneto Micro Cruiser[2]: 22"

Haven't ridden, but would love to try. Much cheaper but a bit longer than I was thinking. More like an old school skateboard with the tiny trucks, but I'm sure rides well.

### Penny Board[8]: 22"

Rode one of these while on tour in Washington. Hit a crack and ate it, but I assume I was just being reckless. Probably best for nicely paved areas or good streets, as the wheelbase is 14".

### DIY

Make your own board! You could cut out a smaller board from a normal skateboard[6 @ 0:16, 7, 8], make one out of an old snow ski that's 15" long[3], make one from a piece of 3/4"-1" thick oak cut out and sanded with varnish (I did this and used it for years), or use multiple layers of 1/8" thick hardwood with fiberglass between[4-5]. You could even make one out of a hockey stick[6 @ 0:17].

TODO: Make a guide for making your own.
