## Alternatives

### Mastodon/Misskey/Pleroma[11-13]

These are all alternatives to Twitter, Facebook, etc., where you have a profile and write out statuses to connect with others. Instead of one large space, there are smaller instances or communities you can join. This allows better communication, friendships, and moderation for everyone involved.

It can feel weird because it operates differently than conventional social media you are used to. You can get questions answered at the wiki[14].

### Lemmy[15]

Lemmy is an alternative to Reddit for sharing links.

## Ad- and Tracker-Free Proxies

These are all ways to get the same content you would normally see on any of these platforms but without the Javascript bloat of trackers and advertisements. This usually reults in *much* faster load times, much lower bandwidth, and less data tracking for gross companies.

You can automate a lot of these switches by using an extension to automate it for you[9], or something like Redirector for Firefox[8] to automatically replace portions of the URL, like `reddit.com` with `teddit.org`, etc.
