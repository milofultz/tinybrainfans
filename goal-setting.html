<p>Notes on CGP Grey's &quot;Your Theme&quot; video[1]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting intentions towards what kind of person you want to be is more effective than setting goals, especially if you are the kind of person to be discouraged by &quot;failing&quot;.</li>
<li>Themes should be broad, directional, and resonant. Broad so that you aren't stuck in a pass/fail paradigm, directional that you know what choice to make when confronted with one, and resonant so that you earnestly want to pursue it in an almost hedonistic, visceral sense.</li>
<li>The word should mean something to <em>you</em>. It does <em>not</em> need to mean anything to anyone else. Only <em>your</em> definition matters.</li>
<li>These broad ideas or &quot;goals&quot; are good because they will get you to the crossroads to make decisions you want. Like meditation prepares you to consider choices once you center yourself, this gives you a large area to aim for.</li>
<li>It doesn't have to be a year. Years are just nice because of new years resolutions. Set a timeline that is good for you to be able to check in again at some point.</li>
<li>The potential problem with a year is that <a href="https://12weekyear.com/" target="_blank">12-week year</a> problem. You have motivation for the first month and a half or so, and then usually right at the end. So a quarter kind of wraps that all together.</li>
</ul>
